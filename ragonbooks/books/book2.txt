Introduction

I had no idea when Technical Analysis of the Futures Markets was
published in 1986 that it would create such an impact on the industry.
It has been referred to by many in the field as the "Bible" of technical
analysis. The Market Technicians Association uses it as a primary
source in their testing process for the Chartered Market Technician
program. The Federal Reserve has cited it in research studies that
examine the value of the technical approach. In addition, it has been
translated into eight foreign languages. I was also unprepared for the
long shelf life of the book. It continues to sell as many copies ten
years after it was published as it did in the first couple of years.
It became clear, however, that a lot of new material had been
added to the field of technical analysis in the past decade. I added
some of it myself. My second book, Intermarket Technical Analysis
(Wiley, 1991), helped create that new branch of technical analysis,
which is widely used today. Old techniques like Japanese candlestick
charting and newer ones like Market Profile have become part of the
technical landscape. Clearly, this new work

xxvii

Introduction

needed to be included in any book that attempted to present a
comprehensive picture of technical analysis. The focus of my work
changed as well.
While my main interest ten years ago was in the futures
markets, my recent work has dealt more with the stock market. That
also brought me full circle, since I began my career as a stock analyst
thirty years ago. That was also one of the side effects of my being the
technical analyst for CNBC-TV for seven years. That focus on what
the general public was doing also led to my third book, The Visual
Investor (Wiley, 1996). That book focused on the use of technical
tools for market sectors, primarily through mutual funds, which have
become extremely popular in the 1990s.
Many of the technical indicators that I wrote about ten years
ago, which had been used primarily in the futures markets, have been
incorporated into stock market work. It was time to show how that
was being done. Finally, like any field or discipline, writers also
evolve. Some things that seemed very important to me ten years ago
aren't as important today. As my work has evolved into a broader
application of technical principles to all financial markets, it seemed
only right that any revision of that earlier work should reflect that
evolution.
I've tried to retain the structure of the original book.
Therefore, many of the original chapters remain. However, they have
been revised with new material and updated with new graphics. Since
the principles of technical analysis are universal, it wasn't that
difficult to broaden the focus to include all financial markets. Since
the original focus was on futures, however, a lot of stock market
material has been added.
Three new chapters have been added. The two previous
chapters on point and figure charting (Chapters 11 and 12) have been
merged into one. A new Chapter 12 on candlestick charting has been
inserted. Two additional chapters have also been added at the end of
the book. Chapter 17 is an introduction to my work on intermarket
analysis. Chapter 18 deals with stock market indicators. We've
replaced the previous appendices with new ones. Market Profile is
introduced in Appendix B. The other appendices show some of the
more advanced technical indicators and explain how to build a
technical trading system. There's also a glossary.

I approached this revision with some trepidation. I wasn't sure
redoing a book considered a "classic" was such a good idea. I hope
I've succeeded in making it even better. I approached this work from
the perspective of a more seasoned and mature writer and analyst.
And, throughout the book, I tried to show the respect I have always
had for the discipline of technical analysis and for the many talented
analysts who practice it. The success of their work, as well as their
dedication to this field, has always been a source of comfort and
inspiration to me. I only hope I did justice to it and to them.

The person who deserves the most credit for the second edition of this
book is Ellen Schneid Coleman, Executive Editor at Simon &
Schuster. She convinced me that it was time to revise Technical
Analysis of the Futures Markets and broaden its scope. I'm glad she
was so persistent. Special thanks go to the folks at Omega Research
who provided me with the charting software I needed and, in particular, Gaston Sanchez who spent a lot of time on the phone with me.
The contributing authors—Tom Aspray, Dennis Hynes, and Fred
Schutzman—added their particular expertise where it was needed. In
addition, several analysts contributed charts including Michael Burke,
Stan Ehrlich, Jerry Toepke, Ken Tower, and Nick Van Nice. The
revision of Chapter 2 on Dow Theory was a collaborative effort with
Elyce Picciotti, an independent technical writer and market consultant
in New Orleans, Louisiana. Greg Morris deserves special mention. He
wrote the chapter on candlestick charting, contributed the article in
Appendix D, and did most of the graphic work. Fred Dahl of Inkwell
Publishing Services (Fishkill, NY), who handled production of the
first edition of this book, did this one as well. It was great working
with him again.

Philosophy of Technical
Analysis

INTRODUCTION
Before beginning a study of the actual techniques and tools used in
technical analysis, it is necessary first to define what technical
analysis is, to discuss the philosophical premises on which it is based,
to draw some clear distinctions between technical and fundamental
analysis and, finally, to address a couple of criticisms frequently
raised against the technical approach.
The author's strong belief is that a full appreciation of the
technical approach must begin with a clear understanding of what
technical analysis claims to be able to do and, maybe even more
importantly, the philosophy or rationale on which it bases those
claims.
First, let's define the subject. Technical analysis is the study of
market action, primarily through the use of charts, for the purpose of
forecasting future price trends. The term "market action" includes the
three principal sources of information available to the techni-

I

Chapter 1

cian—price, volume, and open interest. (Open interest is used only in
futures and options.) The term "price action," which is often used,
seems too narrow because most technicians include volume and open
interest as an integral part of their market analysis. With this
distinction made, the terms "price action" and "market action" are
used interchangeably throughout the remainder of this discussion.

PHILOSOPHY OR RATIONALE
There are three premises on which the technical approach is based:
1. Market action discounts everything.
2. Prices move in trends.
3. History repeats itself.
Market Action Discounts Everything
The statement "market action discounts everything" forms what is
probably the cornerstone of technical analysis. Unless the full
significance of this first premise is fully understood and accepted,
nothing else that follows makes much sense. The technician believes
that anything that can possibly affect the price—fundamentally,
politically, psychologically, or otherwise—is actually reflected in the
price of that market. It follows, therefore, that a study of price action
is all that is required. While this claim may seem presumptuous, it is
hard to disagree with if one takes the time to consider its true
meaning.
All the technician is really claiming is that price action should
reflect shifts in supply and demand. If demand exceeds supply, prices
should rise. If supply exceeds demand, prices should fall. This action
is the basis of all economic and fundamental forecasting. The
technician then turns this statement around to arrive at the conclusion
that if prices are rising, for whatever the specific reasons, demand
must exceed supply and the fundamentals must be bullish. If prices
fall, the fundamen-

www.Fxborssa.com

Philosophy of Technical Analysis

3

tals must be bearish. If this last comment about fundamentals seems
surprising in the context of a discussion of technical analysis, it
shouldn't. After all, the technician is indirectly studying
fundamentals. Most technicians would probably agree that it is the
underlying forces of supply and demand, the economic fundamentals
of a market, that cause bull and bear markets. The charts do not in
themselves cause markets to move up or down. They simply reflect
the bullish or bearish psychology of the marketplace.
As a rule, chartists do not concern themselves with the reasons
why prices rise or fall. Very often, in the early stages of a price trend
or at critical turning points, no one seems to know exactly why a
market is performing a certain way. While the technical approach
may sometimes seem overly simplistic in its claims, the logic behind
this first premise—that markets discount everything—becomes more
compelling the more market experience one gains. It follows then that
if everything that affects market price is ultimately reflected in
market price, then the study of that market price is all that is
necessary. By studying price charts and a host of supporting technical
indicators, the chartist in effect lets the market tell him or her which
way it is most likely to go. The chartist does not necessarily try to
outsmart or outguess the market. All of the technical tools discussed
later on are simply techniques used to aid the chartist in the process
of studying market action. The chartist knows there are reasons why
markets go up or down. He or she just doesn't believe that knowing
what those reasons are is necessary in the forecasting process.
Prices Move in Trends
The concept of trend is absolutely essential to the technical approach.
Here again, unless one accepts the premise that markets do in fact
trend, there's no point in reading any further. The whole purpose of
charting the price action of a market is to identify trends in early
stages of their development for the purpose of trading in the direction
of those trends. In fact, most of the techniques used in this approach
are trend-following in nature, meaning that their intent is to identify
and follow existing trends. (See Figure 1.1.)

Figure 1.1 Example of an uptrend. Technical analysis is based on the
premise that markets trend and that those trends tend to persist.
There is a corollary to the premise that prices move in
trends—a trend in motion is more likely to continue than to reverse.
This corollary is, of course, an adaptation of Newton's first law of
motion. Another way to state this corollary is that a trend in motion
will continue in the same direction until it reverses. This is another
one of those technical claims that seems almost circular. But the
entire trend-following approach is predicated on riding an existing
trend until it shows signs of reversing.
History Repeats Itself
Much of the body of technical analysis and the study of market
action has to do with the study of human psychology. Chart patterns,
for example, which have been identified and categorized over the
past one hundred years, reflect certain pictures that appear on price
charts. These pictures reveal the bullish or bearish

www.Fxborssa.com

Philosophy of Technical Analysis

psychology of the market. Since these patterns have worked well in
the past, it is assumed that they will continue to work well in the
future. They are based on the study of human psychology, which
tends not to change. Another way of saying this last premise—that
history repeats itself—is that the key to understanding the future lies
in a study of the past, or that the future is just a repetition of the past.

TECHNICAL VERSUS
FUNDAMENTAL FORECASTING
While technical analysis concentrates on the study of market action,
fundamental analysis focuses on the economic forces of supply and
demand that cause prices to move higher, lower, or stay the same.
The fundamental approach examines all of the relevant factors
affecting the price of a market in order to determine the intrinsic
value of that market. The intrinsic value is what the fundamentals
indicate something is actually worth based on the law of supply and
demand. If this intrinsic value is under the current market price, then
the market is overpriced and should be sold. If market price is below
the intrinsic value, then the market is undervalued and should be
bought.
Both of these approaches to market forecasting attempt to
solve the same problem, that is, to determine the direction prices are
likely to move. They just approach the problem from different
directions. The fundamentalist studies the cause of market movement,
while the technician studies the effect. The technician, of course,
believes that the effect is all that he or she wants or needs to know
and that the reasons, or the causes, are unnecessary. The fundamentalist always has to know why.
Most traders classify themselves as either technicians or
fundamentalists. In reality, there is a lot of overlap. Many fundamentalists have a working knowledge of the basic tenets of chart
analysis. At the same time, many technicians have at least a passing
awareness of the fundamentals. The problem is that the charts and
fundamentals are often in conflict with each other. Usually at the
beginning of important market moves, the fundamentals do

www.Fxborssa.com

6

Chapter 1

not explain or support what the market seems to be doing. It is at
these critical times in the trend that these two approaches seem to
differ the most. Usually they come back into sync at some point, but
often too late for the trader to act.
One explanation for these seeming discrepancies is that
market price tends to lead the known fundamentals. Stated another
way, market price acts as a leading indicator of the fundamentals or the
conventional wisdom of the moment. While the known fundamentals
have already been discounted and are already "in the market," prices
are now reacting to the unknown fundamentals. Some of the most
dramatic bull and bear markets in history have begun with little or no
perceived change in the fundamentals. By the time those changes
became known, the new trend was well underway.
After a while, the technician develops increased confidence in
his or her ability to read the charts. The technician learns to be
comfortable in a situation where market movement disagrees with the
so-called conventional wisdom. A technician begins to enjoy being in
the minority. He or she knows that eventually the reasons for market
action will become common knowledge. It is just that the technician
isn't willing to wait for that added confirmation.
In accepting the premises of technical analysis, one can see
why technicians believe their approach is superior to the fundamentalists. If a trader had to choose only one of the two approaches
to use, the choice would logically have to be the technical. Because,
by definition, the technical approach includes the fundamental. If the
fundamentals are reflected in market price, then the study of those
fundamentals becomes unnecessary. Chart reading becomes a
shortcut form of fundamental analysis. The reverse, however, is not
true. Fundamental analysis does not include a study of price action. It
is possible to trade financial markets using just the technical
approach. It is doubtful that anyone could trade off the fundamentals
alone with no consideration of the technical side of the market.

ANALYSIS VERSUS TIMING
This last point is made clearer if the decision making process is
broken down into two separate stages—analysis and timing.

www.Fxborssa.com

Philosophy of Technical Analysis

Because of the high leverage factor in the futures markets, timing is
especially crucial in that arena. It is quite possible to be correct on the
general trend of the market and still lose money. Because margin
requirements are so low in futures trading (usually less than 10%), a
relatively small price move in the wrong direction can force the trader
out of the market with the resulting loss of all or most of that margin.
In stock market trading, by contrast, a trader who finds him or herself
on the wrong side of the market can simply decide to hold onto the
stock, hoping that it will stage a comeback at some point.
Futures traders don't have that luxury. A "buy and hold"
strategy doesn't apply to the futures arena. Both the technical and the
fundamental approach can be used in the first phase—the forecasting
process. However, the question of timing, of determining specific
entry and exit points, is almost purely technical. Therefore,
considering the steps the trader must go through before making a
market commitment, it can be seen that the correct application of
technical principles becomes indispensable at some point in the
process, even if fundamental analysis was applied in the earlier stages
of the decision. Timing is also important in individual stock selection
and in the buying and selling of stock market sector and industry
groups.

FLEXIBILITY AND ADAPTABILITY OF
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
One of the great strengths of technical analysis is its adaptability to
virtually any trading medium and time dimension. There is no area of
trading in either stocks or futures where these principles do not apply.
The chartist can easily follow as many markets as desired,
which is generally not true of his or her fundamental counterpart.
Because of the tremendous amount of data the latter must deal with,
most fundamentalists tend to specialize. The advantages here should
not be overlooked.
For one thing, markets go through active and dormant
periods, trending and nontrending stages. The technician can

www.Fxborssa.com

8

Chapter 1

concentrate his or her attention and resources in those markets that
display strong trending tendencies and choose to ignore the rest. As a
result, the chartist can rotate his or her attention and capital to take
advantage of the rotational nature of the markets. At different times,
certain markets become "hot" and experience important trends.
Usually, those trending periods are followed by quiet and relatively
trendless market conditions, while another market or group takes
over. The technical trader is free to pick and choose. The
fundamentalist, however, who tends to specialize in only one group,
doesn't have that kind of flexibility. Even if he or she were free to
switch groups, the fundamentalist would have a much more difficult
time doing so than would the chartist.
Another advantage the technician has is the "big picture." By
following all of the markets, he or she gets an excellent feel for what
markets are doing in general, and avoids the "tunnel vision" that can
result from following only one group of markets. Also, because so
many of the markets have built-in economic relationships and react to
similar economic factors, price action in one market or group may
give valuable clues to the future direction of another market or group
of markets.

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
APPLIED TO DIFFERENT
TRADING MEDIUMS
The principles of chart analysis apply to both stocks and futures.
Actually, technical analysis was first applied to the stock market and
later adapted to futures. With the introduction of stock index futures,
the dividing line between these two areas is rapidly disappearing.
International stock markets are also charted and analyzed according
to technical principles. (See Figure 1.2.)
Financial futures, including interest rate markets and foreign
currencies, have become enormously popular over the past decade
and have proven to be excellent subjects for chart analysis.
Technical principles play a role in options trading. Technical
forecasting can also be used to great advantage in the hedging
process.

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS APPLIED TO
DIFFERENT TIME DIMENSIONS
Another strength of the charting approach is its ability to handle
different time dimensions. Whether the user is trading the intra-day
tic-by-tic changes for day trading purposes or trend trading the
intermediate trend, the same principles apply. A time dimension often
overlooked is longer range technical forecasting? The opinion
expressed in some quarters that charting is useful only in the short
term is simply not true. It has been suggested by some that
fundamental analysis should be used for long term forecasting with
technical factors limited to short term timing. The fact is that longer
range forecasting, using weekly and monthly charts going back
several years, has proven to be an extremely useful application of
these techniques.

Chapter 1

Once the technical principles discussed in this book are thoroughly understood, they will provide the user with tremendous flexibility as to how they can be applied, both from the standpoint of the
medium to be analyzed and the time dimension to be studied.

ECONOMIC FORECASTING
Technical analysis can play a role in economic forecasting. For
example, the direction of commodity prices tells us something about
the direction of inflation. They also give us clues about the strength
or weakness of the economy. Rising commodity prices generally hint
at a stronger economy and rising inflationary pressure. Falling
commodity prices usually warn that the economy is slowing along
with inflation. The direction of interest rates is affected by the trend
of commodities. As a result, charts of commodity markets like gold
and oil, along with Treasury Bonds, can tell us a lot about the
strength or weakness of the economy and inflationary expectations.
The direction of the U.S. dollar and foreign currency futures also
provide early guidance about the strength or weakness of the
respective global economies. Even more impressive is the fact that
trends in these futures markets usually show up long before they are
reflected in traditional economic indicators that are released on a
monthly or quarterly basis, and usually tell us what has already
happened. As their name implies, futures markets usually give us
insights into the future. The S&P 500 stock market index has long
been counted as an official leading economic indicator. A book by
one of the country's top experts on the business cycle, Leading
Indicators for the 1990s (Moore), makes a compelling case for the
importance of commodity, bond, and stock trends as economic
indicators. All three markets can be studied employing technical
analysis. We'll have more to say on this subject in Chapter 17, "The
Link Between Stocks and Futures."

TECHNICIAN OR CHARTIST?
There are several different titles applied to practitioners of the
technical approach: technical analyst, chartist, market analyst,

www.Fxborssa.com

Philosophy of Technical Analysis

11

and visual analyst. Up until recently, they all meant pretty much the
same thing. However, with increased specialization in the field, it has
become necessary to make some further distinctions and define the
terms a bit more carefully. Because virtually all technical analysis
was based on the use of charts up until the last decade, the terms
"technician" and "chartist" meant the same thing. This is no longer
necessarily true.
The broader area of technical analysis is being increasingly
divided into two types of practitioners, the traditional chartist and, for
want of a better term, statistical technicians. Admittedly, there is a lot
of overlap here and most technicians combine both areas to some
extent. As in the case of the technician versus the fundamentalist,
most seem to fall into one category or the other.
Whether or not the traditional chartist uses quantitative work
to supplement his or her analysis, charts remain the primary working
tool. Everything else is secondary. Charting, of necessity, remains
somewhat subjective. The success of the approach depends, for the
most part, on the skill of the individual chartist. The term "art
charting" has been applied to this approach because chart reading is
largely an art.
By contrast, the statistical, or quantitative, analyst takes these
subjective principles, quantifies, tests, and optimizes them for the
purpose of developing mechanical trading systems. These systems, or
trading models, are then programmed into a computer that generates
mechanical "buy" and "sell" signals. These systems range from the
simple to the very complex. However, the intent is to reduce or
completely eliminate the subjective human element in trading, to
make it more scientific. These statisticians may or may not use price
charts in their work, but they are considered technicians as long as
their work is limited to the study of market action.
Even computer technicians can be subdivided further into
those who favor mechanical systems, or the "black box" approach,
and those who use computer technology to develop better technical
indicators. The latter group maintains control over the interpretation
of those indicators and also the decision making process.

www.Fxborssa.com

12

Chapter 1

One way of distinguishing between the chartist and the
statistician is to say that all chartists are technicians, but not all
technicians are chartists. Although these terms are used interchangeably throughout this book, it should be remembered that
charting represents only one area in the broader subject of technical
analysis.

A BRIEF COMPARISON OF
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS IN
STOCKS AND FUTURES
A question often asked is whether technical analysis as applied to
futures is the same as the stock market. The answer is both yes and
no. The basic principles are the same, but there are some significant
differences. The principles of technical analysis were first applied to
stock market forecasting and only later adapted to futures. Most of
the basic tools—bar charts, point and figure charts, price patterns,
volume, trendlines, moving averages, and oscillators, for example—
are used in both areas. Anyone who has learned these concepts in
either stocks or futures wouldn't have too much trouble making the
adjustment to the other side. However, there are some general areas
of difference having more to do with the different nature of stocks
and futures than with the actual tools themselves.
Pricing Structure
The pricing structure in futures is much more complicated than in
stocks. Each commodity is quoted in different units and increments.
Grain markets, for example, are quoted in cents per bushel, livestock
markets in cents per pound, gold and silver in dollars per ounce, and
interest rates in basis points. The trader must learn the contract
details of each market: which exchange it is traded on, how each
contract is quoted, what the minimum and maximum price
increments are, and what these price increments are worth.
Limited Life Span
Unlike stocks, futures contracts have expiration dates. A March 1999
Treasury Bond contract, for example, expires in March of

www.Fxborssa.com

Philosophy of Technical Analysis

13

1999. The typical futures contract trades for about a year and a half
before expiration. Therefore, at any one time, at least a half dozen
different contract months are trading in the same commodity at the
same time. The trader must know which contracts to trade and which
ones to avoid. (This is explained later in this book.) This limited life
feature causes some problems for longer range price forecasting. It
necessitates the continuing need for obtaining new charts once old
contracts stop trading. The chart of an expired contract isn't of much
use. New charts must be obtained for the newer contracts along with
their own technical indicators. This constant rotation makes the
maintenance of an ongoing chart library a good deal more difficult.
For computer users, it also entails greater time and expense by
making it necessary to be constantly obtaining new historical data as
old contracts expire.
Lower Margin Requirements
This is probably the most important difference between stocks and
futures. All futures are traded on margin, which is usually less than
10% of the value of the contract. The result of these low margin
requirements is tremendous leverage. Relatively small price moves in
either direction tend to become magnified in their impact on overall
trading results. For this reason, it is possible to make or lose large
sums of money very quickly in futures. Because a trader puts up only
10% of the value of the contract as margin, then a 10% move in
either direction will either double the trader's money or wipe it out.
By magnifying the impact of even minor market moves, the high
leverage factor sometimes makes the futures markets seem more
volatile than they actually are. When someone says, for example, that
he or she was "wiped out" in the futures market, remember that he or
she only committed 10% in the first place.
From the standpoint of technical analysis, the high leverage
factor makes timing in the futures markets much more critical than it
is in stocks. The correct timing of entry and exit points is crucial in
futures trading and much more difficult and frustrating than market
analysis. Largely for this reason, technical trading skills become
indispensable to a successful futures trading program.

Chapter 1

Time Frame Is Much Shorter
Because of the high leverage factor and the need for close monitoring
of market positions, the time horizon of the commodity trader is
much shorter of necessity. Stock market technicians tend to look
more at the longer range picture and talk in time frames that are
beyond the concern of the average commodity trader. Stock
technicians may talk about where the market will be in three or six
months. Futures traders want to know where prices will be next
week, tomorrow, or maybe even later this afternoon. This has
necessitated the refinement of very short term timing tools. One
example is the moving average. The most commonly watched
averages in stocks are 50 and 200 days. In commodities, most
moving averages are under 40 days. A popular moving average
combination in futures, for example, is 4, 9, and 18 days.
Greater Reliance on Timing
Timing is everything in futures trading. Determining the correct
direction of the market only solves a portion of the trading problem.
If the timing of the entry point is off by a day, or sometimes even
minutes, it can mean the difference between a winner or a loser. It's
bad enough to be on the wrong side of the market and lose money.
Being on the right side of the market and still losing money is one of
the most frustrating and unnerving aspects of futures trading. It goes
without saying that timing is almost purely technical in nature,
because the fundamentals rarely change on a day-to-day basis.

LESS RELIANCE ON MARKET
AVERAGES AND INDICATORS
Stock market analysis is based heavily on the movement of broad
market averages—such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the
S&P 500. In addition, technical indicators that measure the strength
or weakness of the broader market—like the NYSE advance-decline
line or the new highs-new lows list—are heavily employed. While
commodity markets can be tracked using mea-

www.Fxborssa.com

Philosophy of Technical Analysis

15

sures like the Commodity Research Bureau Futures Price Index, less
emphasis is placed on the broader market approach. Commodity
market analysis concentrates more on individual market action. That
being the case, technical indicators that measure broader commodity
trends aren't used much. With only about 20 or so active commodity
markets, there isn't much need.
Specific Technical Tools
While most of the technical tools originally developed in the stock
market have some application in commodity markets, they are not
used in the exact same way. For example, chart patterns in futures
often tend not to form as fully as they do in stocks.
Futures traders rely more heavily on shorter term indicators
that emphasize more precise trading signals. These points of
difference and many others are discussed later in this book.
Finally, there is another area of major difference between
stocks and futures. Technical analysis in stocks relies much more
heavily on the use of sentiment indicators and flow of funds analysis.
Sentiment indicators monitor the performance of different groups
such as odd lotters, mutual funds, and floor specialists. Enormous
importance is placed on sentiment indicators that measure the overall
market bullishness and bearishness on the theory that the majority
opinion is usually wrong. Flow of funds analysis refers to the cash
position of different groups, such as mutual funds or large
institutional accounts. The thinking here is that the larger the cash
position, the more funds that are available for stock purchases.
Technical analysis in the futures markets is a much purer form of
price analysis. While contrary opinion theory is also used to some
extent, much more emphasis is placed on basic trend analysis and the
application of traditional technical indicators.

SOME CRITICISMS OF THE
TECHNICAL APPROACH
A few questions generally crop up in any discussion of the technical
approach. One of these concerns is the self-fulfilling prophe-

www.Fxborssa.com

16

Chapter 1

cy. Another is the question of whether or not past price data can
really be used to forecast future price direction. The critic usually
says something like: "Charts tell us where the market has been, but
can't tell us where it is going." For the moment, we'll put aside the
obvious answer that a chart won't tell you anything if you don't know
how to read it. The Random Walk Theory questions whether prices
trend at all and doubts that any forecasting technique can beat a
simple buy and hold strategy. These questions deserve a response.
The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy
The question of whether there is a self-fulfilling prophecy at work
seems to bother most people because it is raised so often. It is certainly a valid concern, but of much less importance than most people
realize. Perhaps the best way to address this question is to quote from
a text that discusses some of the disadvantages of using chart
patterns:
a. The use of most chart patterns has been widely publicized in
the last several years. Many traders are quite familiar with
these patterns and often act on them in concert. This creates
a "self-fulfilling prophecy," as waves of buying or selling are
created in response to "bullish" or "bearish" patterns. . .
b. Chart patterns are almost completely subjective. No study
has yet succeeded in mathematically quantifying any of
them. They are literally in the mind of the beholder....
(Teweles et al.)
These two criticisms contradict one another and the second
point actually cancels out the first. If chart patterns are "completely
subjective" and "in the mind of the beholder," then it is hard to
imagine how everyone could see the same thing at the same time,
which is the basis of the self-fulfilling prophecy. Critics of charting
can't have it both ways. They can't, on the one hand, criticize charting
for being so objective and obvious that everyone will act in the same
way at the same time (thereby causing the price pattern to be
fulfilled), and then also criticize charting for being too subjective.

www.Fxborssa.com

Philosophy of Technical Analysis

17

The truth of the matter is that charting is very subjective.
Chart reading is an art. (Possibly the word "skill" would be more to
the point.) Chart patterns are seldom so clear that even experienced
chartists always agree on their interpretation. There is always an
element of doubt and disagreement. As this book demonstrates, there
are many different approaches to technical analysis that often
disagree with one another.
Even if most technicians did agree on a market forecast, they
would not all necessarily enter the market at the same time and in the
same way. Some would try to anticipate the chart signal and enter the
market early. Others would buy the "breakout" from a given pattern
or indicator. Still others would wait for the pullback after the
breakout before taking action. Some traders are aggressive; others are
conservative. Some use stops to enter the market, while others like to
use market orders or resting limit orders. Some are trading for the
long pull, while others are day trading. Therefore, the possibility of
all technicians acting at the same time and in the same way is actually
quite remote.
Even if the self-fulfilling prophecy were of major concern, it
would probably be "self-correcting" in nature. In other words, traders
would rely heavily on charts until their concerted actions started to
affect or distort the markets. Once traders realized this was
happening, they would either stop using the charts or adjust their
trading tactics. For example, they would either try to act before the
crowd or wait longer for greater confirmation. So, even if the selffulfilling prophecy did become a problem over the near term, it
would tend to correct itself.
It must be kept in mind that bull and bear markets only occur
and are maintained when they are justified by the law of supply and
demand. Technicians could not possibly cause a major market move
just by the sheer power of their buying and selling. If this were the
case, technicians would all become wealthy very quickly.
Of much more concern than the chartists is the tremendous
growth in the use of computerized technical trading systems in the
futures market. These systems are mainly trend-following in nature,
which means that they are all programmed to identify and trade major
trends. With the growth in professionally man-

www.Fxborssa.com

18

Chapter 7

aged money in the futures industry, and the proliferation of multimillion-dollar public and private funds, most of which are using
these technical systems, tremendous concentrations of money are
chasing only a handful of existing trends. Because the universe of
futures markets is still quite small, the potential for these systems
distorting short term price action is growing. However, even in cases
where distortions do occur, they are generally short term in nature
and do not cause major moves.
Here again, even the problem of concentrated sums of money
using technical systems is probably self-correcting. If all of the
systems started doing the same thing at the same time, traders would
make adjustments by making their systems either more or less
sensitive.
The self-fulfilling prophecy is generally listed as a criticism
of charting. It might be more appropriate to label it as a compliment.
After all, for any forecasting technique to become so popular that it
begins to influence events, it would have to be pretty good. We can
only speculate as to why this concern is seldom raised regarding the
use of fundamental analysis.
Can the Past Be Used to Predict the Future?
Another question often raised concerns the validity of using past
price data to predict the future. It is surprising how often critics of the
technical approach bring up this point because every known method
of forecasting, from weather predicting to fundamental analysis, is
based completely on the study of past data. What other kind of data is
there to work with?
The field of statistics makes a distinction between descriptive
statistics and inductive statistics. Descriptive statistics refers to the
graphical presentation of data, such as the price data on a standard
bar chart. Inductive statistics refers to generalizations, predictions, or
extrapolations that are inferred from that data. Therefore, the price
chart itself comes under the heading of the descriptive, while the
analysis technicians perform on that price data falls into the realm of
the inductive.
As one statistical text puts it, "The first step in forecasting the
business or economic future consists, thus, of gathering obser-

www.Fxborssa.com

Philosophy of Technical Analysis

19

vations from the past." (Freund and Williams) Chart analysis is just
another form of time series analysis, based on a study of the past,
which is exactly what is done in all forms of time series analysis. The
only type of data anyone has to go on is past data. We can only
estimate the future by projecting past experiences into that future.
So it seems that the use of past price data to predict the future
in technical analysis is grounded in sound statistical concepts. If
anyone were to seriously question this aspect of technical forecasting,
he or she would have to also question the validity of every other form
of forecasting based on historical data, which includes all economic
and fundamental analysis.

RANDOM WALK THEORY
The Random Walk Theory, developed and nurtured in the academic
community, claims that price changes are "serially independent" and
that price history is not a reliable indicator of future price direction.
In a nutshell, price movement is random and unpredictable. The
theory is based on the efficient market hypothesis, which holds that
prices fluctuate randomly about their intrinsic value. It also holds that
the best market strategy to follow would be a simple "buy and hold"
strategy as opposed to any attempt to "beat the market."
While there seems little doubt that a certain amount of
randomness or "noise" does exist in all markets, it's just unrealistic to
believe that all price movement is random. This may be one of those
areas where empirical observation and practical experience prove
more useful than sophisticated statistical techniques, which seem
capable of proving anything the user has in mind or incapable of
disproving anything. It might be useful to keep in mind that
randomness can only be defined in the negative sense of an inability
to uncover systematic patterns in price action. The fact that many
academics have not been able to discover the presence of these
patterns does not prove that they do not exist.
The academic debate as to whether markets trend is of little
interest to the average market analyst or trader who is forced

www.Fxborssa.com

20

Chapter 1

to deal in the real world where market trends are clearly visible. If the
reader has any doubts on this point, a casual glance through any chart
book (randomly selected) will demonstrate the presence of trends in a
very graphic way. How do the "random walkers" explain the
persistence of these trends if prices are serially independent, meaning
that what happened yesterday, or last week, has no bearing on what
may happen today or tomorrow? How do they explain the profitable
"real life" track records of many trend-following systems?
How, for example, would a buy and hold strategy fare in the
commodity futures markets where timing is so crucial? Would those
long positions be held during bear markets? How would traders even
know the difference between bull and bear markets if prices are
unpredictable and don't trend? In fact, how could a bear market even
exist in the first place because that would imply a trend? (See Figure
1.3.)

It seems doubtful that statistical evidence will ever totally
prove or disprove the Random Walk Theory. However, the idea that
markets are random is totally rejected by the technical community. If
the markets were truly random, no forecasting technique would work.
Far from disproving the validity of the technical approach, the
efficient market hypothesis is very close to the technical premise that
markets discount everything. The academics, however, feel that
because markets quickly discount all information, there's no way to
take advantage of that information. The basis of technical forecasting,
already touched upon, is that important market information is
discounted in the market price long before it becomes known.
Without meaning to, the academics have very eloquently stated the
need for closely monitoring price action and the futility of trying to
profit from fundamental information, at least over the short term.
Finally, it seems only fair to observe that any process appears
random and unpredictable to those who do not understand the rules
under which that process operates. An electrocardiogram printout, for
example, might appear like a lot of random noise to a layperson. But
to a trained medical person, all those little blips make a lot of sense
and are certainly not random. The working of the markets may appear
random to those who have not taken the time to study the rules of
market behavior. The illusion of randomness gradually disappears as
the skill in chart reading improves. Hopefully, that is exactly what
will happen as the reader progresses through the various sections of
this book.
There may even be hope for the academic world. A number of
leading American universities have begun to explore Behavioral
Finance which maintains that human psychology and securities
pricing are intertwined. That, of course, is the primary basis of
technical analysis.

UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES
When an earlier version of this book was published twelve years ago,
many of the technical timing tools that were explained were used
mainly in the futures markets. Over the past decade, howev-

er, these tools have been widely employed in analyzing stock market
trends. The technical principles that are discussed in this book can be
applied universally to all markets—even mutual funds. One
additional feature of stock market trading that has gained wide
popularity in the past decade has been sector investing, primarily
through index options and mutual funds. Later in the book we'll show
how to determine which sectors are hot and which are not by
applying technical timing tools.

Dow Theory

INTRODUCTION
Charles Dow and his partner Edward Jones founded Dow Jones &
Company in 1882. Most technicians and students of the markets
concur that much of what we call technical analysis today has its
origins in theories first proposed by Dow around the turn of the
century. Dow published his ideas in a series of editorials he wrote for
the Wall Street Journal. Most technicians today recognize and
assimilate Dow's basic ideas, whether or not they recognize the
source. Dow Theory still forms the cornerstone of the study of
technical analysis, even in the face of today's sophisticated computer
technology, and the proliferation of newer and supposedly better
technical indicators.
On July 3,1884, Dow published the first stock market average
composed of the closing prices of eleven stocks: nine railroad
companies and two manufacturing firms. Dow felt that these eleven
stocks provided a good indication of the economic health of the
country. In 1897, Dow determined that two separate indices would
better represent that health, and created a 12 stock industrial index
and a 20 stock rail index. By 1928 the industrial
23

Chapter 2

index had grown to include 30 stocks, the number at which it stands
today. The editors of The Wall Street Journal have updated the list
numerous times in the ensuing years, adding a utility index in 1929.
In 1984, the year that marked the one hundredth anniversary of
Dow's first publication, the Market Technicians Association
presented a Gorham-silver bowl to Dow Jones & Co. According to
the MTA, the award recognized "the lasting contribution that Charles
Dow made to the field of investment analysis. His index, the
forerunner of what today is regarded as the leading barometer of
stock market activity, remains a vital tool for market technicians 80
years after his death."
Unfortunately for us, Dow never wrote a book on his theory.
Instead, he set down his ideas of stock market behavior in a series of
editorials that The Wall Street Journal published around the turn of
the century. In 1903, the year after Dow's death, S.A. Nelson
compiled these essays into a book entitled The ABC of Stock
Speculation. In that work, Nelson first coined the term "Dow's
Theory." Richard Russell, who wrote the introduction to a 1978
reprint, compared Dow's contribution to stock market theory with
Freud's contribution to psychiatry. In 1922, William Peter Hamilton
(Dow's associate and successor at the Journal) categorized and
published Dow's tenets in a book entitled The Stock Market
Barometer. Robert Rhea developed the theory even further in the
Dow Theory (New York: Barron's), published in 1932.
Dow applied his theoretical work to the stock market averages that he created; namely the Industrials and the Rails. However,
most of his analytical ideas apply equally well to all market averages.
This chapter will describe the six basic tenets of Dow Theory and
will discuss how these ideas fit into a modern study of technical
analysis. We will discuss the ramifications of these ideas in the
chapters that follow.

BASIC TENETS
1. The Averages Discount Everything.
The sum and tendency of the transactions of the Stock
Exchange represent the sum of all Wall Street's knowl-

edge of the past, immediate and remote, applied to the
discounting of the future. There is no need to add to the
averages, as some statisticians do, elaborate compilations
of commodity price index numbers, bank clearings, fluctuations in exchange, volume of domestic and foreign
trades or anything else. Wall Street considers all these
things (Hamilton, pp. 40-41).
Sound familiar? The idea that the markets reflect every
possible knowable factor that affects overall supply and demand is
one of the basic premises of technical theory, as was mentioned in
Chapter 1. The theory applies to market averages, as well as it does to
individual markets, and even makes allowances for "acts of God."
While the markets cannot anticipate events such as earthquakes and
various other natural calamities, they quickly discount such
occurrences, and almost instantaneously assimilate their affects into
the price action.
2. The Market Has Three Trends.
Before discussing how trends behave, we must clarify what Dow
considered a trend. Dow defined an uptrend as a situation in which
each successive rally closes higher than the previous rally high, and
each successive rally low also closes higher than the previous rally
low. In other words, an uptrend has a pattern of rising peaks and
troughs. The opposite situation, with successively lower peaks and
troughs, defines a downtrend. Dow's definition has withstood the test
of time and still forms the cornerstone of trend analysis.
Dow believed that the laws of action and reaction apply to the
markets just as they do to the physical universe. He wrote, "Records
of trading show that in many cases when a stock reaches top it will
have a moderate decline and then go back again to near the highest
figures. If after such a move, the price again recedes, it is liable to
decline some distance" (Nelson, page 43).
Dow considered a trend to have three parts, primary, secondary, and minor, which he compared to the tide, waves, and ripples
of the sea. The primary trend represents the tide, the secondary or
intermediate trend represents the waves that make up the tide, and the
minor trends behave like ripples on the waves.

www.Fxborssa.com

26

Chapter 2

An observer can determine the direction of the tide by noting
the highest point on the beach reached by successive waves. If each
successive wave reaches further inland than the preceding one, the
tide is flowing in. When the high point of each successive wave
recedes, the tide has turned out and is ebbing. Unlike actual ocean
tides, which last a matter of hours, Dow conceived of market tides as
lasting for more than a year, and possibly for several years.
The secondary, or intermediate, trend represents corrections
in the primary trend and usually lasts three weeks to three months.
These intermediate corrections generally retrace between one-third
and two-thirds of the previous trend movement and most frequently
about half, or 50%, of the previous move.
According to Dow, the minor (or near term) trend usually
lasts less than three weeks. This near term trend represents fluctuations in the intermediate trend. We will discuss trend concepts in
greater detail in Chapter 4, "Basic Concepts of Trends," where you
will see that we continue to use the same basic concepts and
terminology today.
3. Major Trends Have Three Phases.
Dow focused his attention on primary or major trends, which he felt
usually take place in three distinct phases: an accumulation phase, a
public participation phase, and a distribution phase. The
accumulation phase represents informed buying by the most astute
investors. If the previous trend was down, then at this point these
astute investors recognize that the market has assimilated all the socalled "bad" news. The public participation phase, where most
technical trend-followers begin to participate, occurs when prices
begin to advance rapidly and business news improves. The
distribution phase takes place when newspapers begin to print
increasingly bullish stories; when economic news is better than ever;
and when speculative volume and public participation increase.
During this last phase the same informed investors who began to
"accumulate" near the bear market bottom (when no one else wanted
to buy) begin to "distribute" before anyone else starts selling.

Students of Elliott Wave Theory will recognize this division
of a major bull market into three distinct phases. R. N. Elliott
elaborated upon Rhea's work in Dow Theory, to recognize that a bull
market has three major, upward movements. In Chapter 13, "Elliott
Wave Theory," we'll show the close similarity between Dow's three
phases of a bull market and the five wave Elliott sequence.
4. The Averages Must Confirm Each Other.
Dow, in referring to the Industrial and Rail Averages, meant that no
important bull or bear market signal could take place unless both
averages gave the same signal, thus confirming each other. He felt
that both averages must exceed a previous secondary peak to confirm
the inception or continuation of a bull market. He did not believe that
the signals had to occur simultaneously, but recognized that a shorter
length of time between the two signals provided stronger
confirmation. When the two averages diverged from one another,
Dow assumed that the prior trend was still maintained. (Elliott Wave
Theory only requires that signals be generated in a single average.)
Chapter 6, "Continuation Patterns," will cover the key concepts of
confirmation and divergence. (See Figures 2.1 and 2.2.)
5. Volume Must Confirm the Trend.
Dow recognized volume as a secondary but important factor in
confirming price signals. Simply stated, volume should expand or
increase in the direction of the major trend. In a major uptrend, volume would then increase as prices move higher, and diminish as
prices fall. In a downtrend, volume should increase as prices drop and
diminish as they rally. Dow considered volume a secondary indicator.
He based his actual buy and sell signals entirely on closing prices. In
Chapter 7, "Volume and Open Interest," we'll cover the subject of
volume and build on Dow's ideas. Today's sophisticated volume
indicators help determine whether volume is increasing or falling off.
Savvy traders then compare this information to price action to see if
the two are confirming each other.

trend to continue, both the Dow Industrials and the Dow Transports must
advance together.
6. A Trend Is Assumed to Be in Effect Until It Gives
Definite Signals That It Has Reversed.
This tenet, which we touched upon in Chapter 1, forms much of the
foundation of modern trend-following approaches. It relates a
physical law to market movement, which states that an object in
motion (in this case a trend) tends to continue in motion until some
external force causes it to change direction. A number of technical
tools are available to traders to assist in the difficult task of spotting
reversal signals, including the study of support and resistance levels,
price patterns, trendlines, and moving averages. Some indicators can
provide even earlier warning signals of loss of momentum. All of that
not withstanding, the odds usually favor that the existing trend will
continue.

Dow Theory

Figure 2.2 Examples of two Dow Theory confirmations. At the start of
1997 (point 1), the Dow Transports confirmed the earlier breakout in the
Industrials. The following May (point 2), the Dow Industrials confirmed the
earlier new high in the Transports.

The most difficult task for a Dow theorist, or any trend-follower for that matter, is being able to distinguish between a normal
secondary correction in an existing trend and the first leg of a new
trend in the opposite direction. Dow theorists often disagree as to
when the market gives an actual reversal signal. Figures 2.3a and
2.3b show how this disagreement manifests itself.
Figures 2.3a and 2.3b illustrate two different market scenarios. In Figure 2.3a, notice that the rally at point C is lower than the
previous peak at A. Price then declines below point B. The presence
of these two lower peaks and two lower troughs gives a clear-cut sell
signal at the point where the low at B is broken (point S). This
reversal pattern is sometimes referred to as a "failure swing."

www.Fxborssa.com

30

Figure 2.3a Failure Swing.
The failure of the peak at C to
overcome A, followed by the
violation of the low at B, constitutes a "sell" signal at S.

Chapter 2

Figure 2.3b Nonfailure Swing. Notice
that C exceeds A before falling below B.
Some Dow theorists would see a "sell" signal at SI, while others would need to see a
lower high at E before turning bearish at S2.

In Figure 2.3b, the rally top at C is higher than the previous
peak at A. Then price declines below point B. Some Dow theorists
would not consider the clear violation of support, at SI, to be a bona
fide sell signal. They would point out that only lower lows exist in
this case, but not lower highs. They would prefer to see a rally to
point E which is lower than point C. Then they would look for
another new low under point D. To them, S2 would represent the
actual sell signal with two lower highs and two lower lows.
The reversal pattern shown in Figure 2.3b is referred to as a
"nonfailure swing." A failure swing (shown in Figure 2.3a) is a much
weaker pattern than the nonfailure swing in Figure 2.3b. Figures 2.4a
and 2.4b show the same scenarios at a market bottom.

THE USE OF CLOSING PRICES AND
THE PRESENCE OF LINES
Dow relied exclusively on closing prices. He believed that averages
had to close higher than a previous peak or lower than a previous
trough to have significance. Dow did not consider intraday penetrations valid.

when point B is exceeded (at Bl).

31

Figure 2.4b Nonfailure Swing
Bottom. "Buy" signals occur at points
Bl or B2.

When traders speak of lines in the averages, they are referring
to horizontal patterns that sometimes occur on the charts. These
sideways trading ranges usually play the role of corrective phases and
are usually referred to as consolidations. In more modern terms, we
might refer to such lateral patterns as "rectangles."

SOME CRITICISMS OF
DOW THEORY
Dow Theory has done well over the years in identifying major bull
and bear markets, but has not escaped criticism. On average, Dow
Theory misses 20 to 25% of a move before generating a signal. Many
traders consider this to be too late. A Dow Theory buy signal usually
occurs in the second phase of an uptrend as price penetrates a
previous intermediate peak. This is also, incidentally, about where
most trend-following technical systems begin to identify and
participate in existing trends.
In response to this criticism, traders must remember that Dow
never intended to anticipate trends; rather he sought to recognize the
emergence of major bull and bear markets and to capture the large
middle portion of important market moves.

www.Fxborssa.com

32

Chapter 2

Available records suggest that Dow's Theory has performed that
function reasonably well. From 1920 to 1975, Dow Theory signals
captured 68% of the moves in the Industrial and Transportation
Averages and 67% of those in the S&P 500 Composite Index
(Source: Barron's). Those who criticize Dow Theory for failing to
catch actual market tops and bottoms lack a basic understanding of
the trend-following philosophy.

STOCKS AS ECONOMIC
INDICATORS
Dow apparently never intended to use his theory to forecast the
direction of the stock market. He felt its real value was to use stock
market direction as a barometric reading of general business conditions. We can only marvel at Dow's vision and genius. In addition
to formulating a great deal of today's price forecasting methodology,
he was among the first to recognize the usefulness of stock market
averages as a leading economic indicator.

DOW THEORY APPLIED TO
FUTURES TRADING
Dow's work considered the behavior of stock averages. While most
of that original work has significant application to commodity
futures, there are some important distinctions between stock and
futures trading. For one thing, Dow assumed that most investors
follow only the major trends and would use intermediate corrections
for timing purposes only. Dow considered the minor or near term
trends to be unimportant. Obviously, this is not the case in futures
trading in which most traders who follow trends trade the
intermediate instead of the major trend. These traders must pay a
great deal of attention to minor swings for timing purposes. If a
futures trader expected an intermediate uptrend to last for a couple of
months, he or she would look for short term dips to signal purchases.
In an intermediate downtrend, the trader would use minor bounces to
signal short sales. The minor trend, therefore, becomes extremely
important in futures trading.

NEW WAYS TO TRADE THE
DOW AVERAGES
For the first 100 years of its existence, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average could only be used as a market indicator. That all changed
on October 6, 1997 when futures and options began trading on
Dow's venerable average for the first time. The Chicago Board of
Trade launched a futures contract on the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, while options on the Dow (symbol: DJX) started trading at
the Chicago Board Options Exchange. In addition, options were also
launched on the Dow Jones Transportation Average (symbol: DJTA)
and the Dow Jones Utility Index (symbol: DJUA). In January 1998, the
American Stock Exchange started trading the Diamonds Trust, a unit
investment trust that mimics the 30 Dow industrials. In addition, two
mutual funds were offered based on the 30 Dow benchmark. Mr.
Dow would probably be happy to know that, a century after their
creation, it would now be possible to trade his Dow averages, and
actually put his Dow Theory into practice.

CONCLUSION
This chapter presented a relatively quick review of the more
important aspects of the Dow Theory. It will become clear, as you
continue through this book, that an understanding and appreciation of
Dow Theory provides a solid foundation for any study of technical
analysis. Much of what is discussed in the following chapters
represents some adaptation of Dow's original theory. The standard
definition of a trend, the classification of a trend into three categories
and phases, the principles of confirmation and divergence, the
interpretation of volume, and the use of percentage retracements (to
name a few), all derive, in one way or another, from Dow Theory.
In addition to the sources already cited in this chapter, an
excellent review of the principles of Dow Theory can be found in
Technical Analysis of Stock Trends (Edwards & Magee).

Chart Construction

INTRODUCTION
This chapter is primarily intended for those readers who are unfamiliar with bar chart construction. We'll begin by discussing the
different types of charts available and then turn our focus to the most
commonly used chart—the daily bar chart. We'll look at how the
price data is read and plotted on the chart. Volume and open interest
are also included in addition to price. We'll then look at other
variations of the bar chart, including longer range weekly and
monthly charts. Once that has been completed, we'll be ready to start
looking at some of the analytical tools applied to that chart in the
following chapter. Those readers already familiar with the charts
themselves might find this chapter too basic. Feel free to move on to
the next chapter.

TYPES OF CHARTS AVAILABLE
The daily bar chart has already been acknowledged as the most
widely used type of chart in technical analysis. There are, however,
other types of charts also used by technicians, such as line charts,
point and figure charts, and more recently, candlesticks. Figure 3.1
shows a standard daily bar chart. It's called a bar chart because each
day's range is represented by a vertical bar. The bar chart shows the
open, high, low, and closing prices. The tic to the right of the vertical
bar is the closing price. The opening price is the tic to the left of the
bar.
Figure 3.2 shows what the same market looks like on a line
chart. In the line chart, only the closing price is plotted for each
successive day. Many chartists believe that because the closing price
is the most critical price of the trading day, a line (or close-only)
chart is a more valid measure of price activity.

Figure 3.2 A line chart of Intel. This type of chart produces a solid line by
connecting the successive closing prices.

A third type of chart, the point and figure chart, is shown in
Figure 3.3. Notice here that the point and figure chart shows the same
price action but in a more compressed format. Notice the alternating
column of x's and o's. The x columns show rising prices and the o
columns, declining prices. Buy and sell signals are more precise and
easier to spot on the point and figure chart than on the bar chart. This
type of chart also has a lot more flexibility. Chapter 11 covers point
and figure charts.

CANDLESTICKS
Candlestick charts are the Japanese version of bar charting and have
become very popular in recent years among western chartists. The
Japanese candlestick records the same four prices as the traditional
bar chart—the open, the close, the high, and the

low. The visual presentation differs however. On the candlestick
chart, a thin line (called the shadow) shows the day's price range
from the high to the low. A wider portion of the bar (called the real
body) measures the distance between the open and the close. If the
close is higher than the open, the real body is white (positive). If the
close is lower than the open, the real body is black (negative). (See
Figure 3.4.)
The key to candlestick charts is the relationship between the
open and the close. Possibly because of the growing popularity of
candlesticks, western chartists now pay a lot more attention to the
opening tic on their bar charts. You can do everything with a
candlestick chart that you can do with a bar chart. In other words, all
the technical tools and indicators we'll be showing you for the bar
chart can also be used on candlesticks. We'll show you a bit later in
the chapter how to construct bar charts for weekly

Chapter 12, "Japanese Candlesticks," provides a more thorough
explanation of candlestick charting.

ARITHMETIC VERSUS
LOGARITHMIC SCALE
Charts can be plotted using arithmetic or logarithmic price scales. For
some types of analysis, particularly for very long range trend
analysis, there may be some advantage to using logarithmic charts.
(See Figures 3.5 and 3.6.) Figure 3.5 shows what the different scales
would look like. On the arithmetic scale, the vertical price scale
shows an equal distance for each price unit of change. Notice in this
example that each point on the arithmetic scale is equidistant. On the
log scale, however, note that the percentage

increases get smaller as the price scale
increases. The distance from points 1
to 2 is the same as the distance from
points 5 to 10 because they both
represent the same doubling in price.
For example, a move from 5 to 10 on
an arithmetic scale would be the same
distance as a move from 50 to 55,
even though the former represents a
doubling in price, while the latter is a
price increase of only 10%. Prices
plotted on ratio or log scales show
equal distances for similar percentage
moves. For example, a move from 10
to 20 (a 100% increase) would be the
same distance on a log chart as a
move from 20 to 40 or 40 to 80. Many
stock market chart services use log
charts, whereas futures chart services
use arithmetic. Charting software
packages allow both types of scaling,
as shown in Figure 3.6.

CONSTRUCTION OF THE DAILY
BAR CHART
The construction of the daily bar chart is extremely simple. The bar
chart is both a price and a time chart. The vertical axis (the y axis)
shows a scale representing the price of the contract. The horizontal
axis (the x axis) records the passage of time. Dates are marked along
the bottom of the the chart. All the user has to do is plot a vertical bar
in the appropriate day from the day's high to the day's low (called the
range). Place a horizontal tic to the right of the vertical bar
identifying the daily closing price. (See Figure 3.7.) The reason for
placing the tic to the right of the bar is to distinguish it from the
opening price, which chartists record to

chart.

the left of the bar. Once that day's activity has been plotted, the user
moves one day to the right to plot the next day's action. Most chart
services use five day weeks. Weekends are not shown on the chart.
Whenever an exchange is closed during the trading week, that day's
space is left blank. The bars along the bottom of the chart measure
volume. (See Figure 3.7.)

VOLUME
Another piece of important information should be included on the bar
chart—volume. Volume represents the total amount of trading
activity in that market for that day. It is the total number of futures
contracts traded during the day or the number of common stock
shares that change hands on a given day in the stock market. The
volume is recorded by a vertical bar at the bottom of the chart under
that day's price bar. A higher volume bar means

the volume was heavier for that day. A smaller bar represents lighter
volume. A vertical scale along the bottom of the chart is provided to
help plot the data, as shown in Figure 3.7.

FUTURES OPEN INTEREST
Open interest is the total number of outstanding futures contracts that
are held by market participants at the end of the day. Open interest is
the number of outstanding contracts held by the longs or the shorts,
not the total of both. Remember, because we're dealing with futures
contracts, for every long there must also be a short. Therefore, we
only have to know the totals on one side. Open interest is marked on
the chart with a solid line along the bottom, usually just above the
volume but below the price. (See Figure 3.8.)

Total Versus Individual Volume and Open
Interest Numbers in Futures
Futures chart services, along with most futures technicians, use only
the total volume and open interest figures. Although figures are
available for each individual delivery month, the total figures for
each commodity market are the ones that are used for forecasting
purposes. There is a good reason for this.
In the early stages of a futures contract's life, volume and
open interest are usually quite small. The figures build up as the
contract reaches maturity. In the last couple of months before
expiration, however, the numbers begin to drop again. Obviously,
traders have to liquidate open positions as the con-

tract approaches expiration. Therefore, the increase in the numbers in
the first few months of life and the decline near the end of trading
have nothing to do with market direction and are just a function of
the limited life feature of a commodity futures contract. To provide
the necessary continuity in volume and open interest numbers, and to
give them forecasting value, the total numbers are generally used.
(Stock charts plot total volume figures, but do not include open
interest.)
Volume and Open Interest Reported a Day Late in
Futures
Futures volume and open interest numbers are reported a day late.
Therefore, the chartist must be content with a day's lag in obtaining
and interpreting the figures. The numbers are usually reported during
the following day's trading hours, but too late for publication in the
day's financial newspapers. Estimated volume figures are available,
however, after the markets close and are included in the following
morning's paper. Estimated volume numbers are just that, but they do
at least give the. futures technician some idea of whether trading
activity was heavier or lighter the previous day. In the morning paper,
therefore, what the reader gets is the last day's futures prices along
with an estimated volume figure. Official volume and open interest
numbers, however, are given for the day before. Stock chartists don't
have that problem. Volume totals for stocks are immediately
available.
The Value of Individual Volume and Open Interest
Numbers in Futures
The individual open interest numbers in futures do provide valuable
information. They tell us which contracts are the most liquid for
trading purposes. As a general rule, trading activity should be limited
to those delivery months with the highest open interest. Months with
low open interest numbers should be avoided. As the term implies,
higher open interest means that there is more interest in certain
delivery months.

Chart Construction

WEEKLY AND MONTHLY
BAR CHARTS
We've focused so far on the daily bar chart. However, be aware that a
bar chart can be constructed for any time period. The intra-day bar
chart measures the high, low, and last prices for periods as short as
five minutes. The average daily bar chart covers from six to nine
months of price action. For longer range trend analysis, however,
weekly and monthly bar charts must be used. The value of using
these longer range charts is covered in Chapter 8. But the method of
constructing and updating the charts is essentially the same. (See
Figures 3.9 and 3.10.)
On the weekly chart, one bar represents the price activity for the
entire week. On the monthly chart, each bar shows the

entire month's price action. Obviously, weekly and monthly charts
compress the price action to allow for much longer range trend
analysis. A weekly chart can go back as much as five years and a
monthly chart up to 20 years. It's a simple technique that helps the
chartist study the markets from a longer range perspective—a valuable perspective that is often lost by relying solely on daily charts.

CONCLUSION
Now that we know how to plot a bar chart, and having introduced the
three basic sources of information—price, volume, and open
interest—we're ready to look at how that data is interpreted.
Remember that the chart only records the data. In itself, it has lit-

tie value. It's much like a paint brush and canvas. By themselves, they
have no value. In the hands of a talented artist, however, they can
help create beautiful images. Perhaps an even better comparison is a
scalpel. In the hands of a gifted surgeon, it can help save lives. In the
hands of most of us, however, a scalpel is not only useless, but might
even be dangerous. A chart can become an extremely useful tool in
the art or skill of market forecasting once the rules are understood.
Let's begin the process. In the next chapter, we'll look at some of the
basic concepts of trend and what I consider to be the building blocks
of chart analysis.

www.Fxborssa.com

Basic Concepts of Trend

DEFINITION OF TREND
The concept of trend is absolutely essential to the technical approach
to market analysis. All of the tools used by the chartist— support and
resistance levels, price patterns, moving averages, trendlines, etc.—
have the sole purpose of helping to measure the trend of the market
for the purpose of participating in that trend. We often hear such
familiar expressions as "always trade in the direction of the trend,"
"never buck the trend," or "the trend is your friend." So let's spend a
little time to define what a trend is and classify it into a few
categories.
In a general sense, the trend is simply the direction of the
market, which way it's moving. But we need a more precise definition
with which to work. First of all, markets don't generally move in a
straight line in any direction. Market moves are characterized by a
series of zigzags. These zigzags resemble a series of successive
waves with fairly obvious peaks and troughs. It is the direction of
those peaks and troughs that constitutes market trend. Whether those
peaks and troughs are moving up, down, or side-

ways tells us the trend of the market. An uptrend would be defined as
a series of successively higher peaks and troughs; a downtrend is just
the opposite, a series of declining peaks and troughs; horizontal
peaks and troughs would identify a sideways price trend. (See
Figures 4.1a-d.)

portion to the left shows a downtrend. From April 1996 to April 1997, the
market traded sideways. During the summer 1997, the trend turned up.

TREND HAS THREE DIRECTIONS
We've mentioned an uptrend, downtrend, and sideways trend for a
very good reason. Most people tend to think of markets as being
always in either an uptrend or a downtrend. The fact of the matter is
that markets actually move in three directions—up, down, and
sideways. It is important to be aware of this distinction because for at
least a third of the time, by a conservative estimate, prices move in a
flat, horizontal pattern that is referred to as a trading range. This type
of sideways action reflects a period of equilibrium in the price level
where the forces of supply and demand are in a state of relative
balance. (If you'll recall, Dow Theory refers to this type of pattern as
a line.) Although we've defined a flat market as having a sideways
trend, it is more commonly referred to as being trendless.

52

Chapter 4

Most technical tools and systems are trend-following in
nature, which means that they are primarily designed for markets that
are moving up or down. They usually work very poorly, or not at all,
when markets enter these lateral or "trendless" phases. It is during
these periods of sideways market movement that technical traders
experience their greatest frustration, and systems traders their
greatest equity losses. A trend-following system, by its very
definition, needs a trend in order to do its stuff. The failure here lies
not with the system. Rather, the failure lies with the trader who is
attempting to apply a system designed for trending markets into a
nontrending market environment.
There are three decisions confronting the trader—whether to
buy a market (go long), sell a market (go short), or do nothing (stand
aside). When a market is rising, the buying strategy is preferable.
When it is falling, the second approach would be correct. However,
when the market is moving sideways, the third choice— to stay out of
the market—is usually the wisest.

TREND HAS THREE
CLASSIFICATIONS
In addition to having three directions, trend is usually broken down
into the three categories mentioned in the previous chapter. Those
three categories are the major, intermediate, and near term trends. In
reality, there are almost an infinite number of trends interacting with
one another, from the very short term trends covering minutes and
hours to superlong trends lasting 50 or 100 years. Most technicians,
however, limit trend classifications to three. There is a certain
amount of ambiguity, however, as to how different analysts define
each trend.
Dow Theory, for example, classifies the major trend as being
in effect for longer than a year. Because futures traders operate in a
shorter time dimension than do stock investors, I would be inclined
to shorten the major trend to anything over six months in the
commodity markets. Dow defined the intermediate, or secondary,
trend as three weeks to as many months, which also appears about
right for the futures markets. The near term trend is usually defined
as anything less than two or three weeks.

www.Fxborssa.com

Basic Concepts of Trend

53

Each trend becomes a portion of its next larger trend. For
example, the intermediate trend would be a correction in the major
trend. In a long term uptrend, the market pauses to correct itself for a
couple of months before resuming its upward path. That secondary
correction would itself consist of shorter waves that would be
identified as near term dips and rallies. This theme recurs many
times—that each trend is part of the next larger trend and is itself
comprised of smaller trends. (See Figures 4.2a and b.)
In Figure 4.2a, the major trend is up as reflected by the rising
peaks and troughs (points 1, 2, 3, 4). The corrective phase (2-3)
represents an intermediate correction within the major uptrend. But
notice that the wave 2-3 also breaks down into three smaller waves
(A, B, C). At point C, the analyst would say that the major trend was
still up, but the intermediate and near term trends were down. At
point 4, all three trends would be up. It is important to understand the
distinction between the various degrees of trend. When someone asks
what the trend is in a given market, it is difficult, if not impossible, to
respond until you know

Figure 4.2a Example of the three degrees of trend: major, secondary, and
near term. Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 show the major uptrend. Wave 2-3 represents a
secondary correction within the major uptrend. Each secondary wave in turn
divides into near term trends. For example, secondary wave 2-3 divides into
minor waves A-B-C.

August to November (three months). The intermediate correction broke down
into three short term trends.

which trend the person is inquiring about. You may have to respond
in the manner previously discussed by defining the three different
trend classifications.
Quite a bit of misunderstanding arises because of different
traders' perceptions as to what is meant by a trend. To long term
position traders, a few days' to a few weeks' price action might be
insignificant. To a day trader, a two or three day advance might
constitute a major uptrend. It's especially important, then, to
understand the different degrees of trend and to make sure that all
involved in a transaction are talking about the same ones.
As a general statement, most trend-following approaches
focus on the intermediate trend, which may last for several months.
The near term trend is used primarily for timing purposes. In an
intermediate uptrend, short term setbacks would be used to initiate
long positions.

SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE
In the previous discussion of trend, it was stated that prices move in a
series of peaks and troughs, and that the direction of those peaks and
troughs determined the trend of the market. Let's now give those
peaks and troughs their appropriate names and, at the same time,
introduce the concepts of support and resistance.
The troughs, or reaction lows, are called support The term is
self-explanatory and indicates that support is a level or area on the
chart under the market where buying interest is sufficiently strong to
overcome selling pressure. As a result, a decline is halted and prices
turn back up again. Usually a support level is identified beforehand
by a previous reaction low. In Figure 4.3a, points 2 and 4 represent
support levels in an uptrend. (See Figures 4.3a and b.)
Resistance is the opposite of support and represents a price
level or area over the market where selling pressure overcomes buying pressure and a price advance is turned back. Usually a resis-

Figure 4.3a Shows rising support and resistance levels in uptrend. Points
2 and 4 are support levels which are usually previous reaction lows. Points 1
and 3 are resistance levels, usually marked by previous peaks.

tance level is identified by a previous peak. In Figure 4.3a, points 1
and 3 are resistance levels. Figure 4.3a shows an uptrend. In an
uptrend, the support and resistance levels show an ascending pattern.
Figure 4.3b shows a downtrend with descending peaks and troughs.
In the downtrend, points 1 and 3 are support levels under the market
and points 2 and 4 are resistance levels over the market.
In an uptrend, the resistance levels represent pauses in that
uptrend and are usually exceeded at some point. In a downtrend,
support levels are not sufficient to stop the decline permanently, but
are able to check it at least temporarily.
A solid grasp of the concepts of support and resistance is
necessary for a full understanding of the concept of trend. For an
uptrend to continue, each successive low (support level) must be
higher than the one preceding it. Each rally high (resistance level)
must be higher than the one before it. If the corrective dip in an
uptrend comes all the way down to the previous low, it may be an
early warning that the uptrend is ending or at least moving from an
uptrend to a sideways trend. If the support level is violated, then a
trend reversal from up to down is likely.

www.Fxborssa.com

57

Basic Concepts of Trend

Each time a previous resistance peak is being tested, the
uptrend is in an especially critical phase. Failure to exceed a previous
peak in an uptrend, or the ability of prices to bounce off the previous
support low in a downtrend, is usually the first warning that the
existing trend is changing. Chapters 5 and 6 on price patterns show
how the testing of these support and resistance levels form pictures
on the charts that suggest either a trend reversal in progress or merely
a pause in the existing trend. But the basic building blocks on which
those price patterns are based are support and resistance levels.
Figures 4.4a-c are examples of a classic trend reversal.
Notice, in Figure 4.4a, that at point 5 prices failed to exceed the
previous peak (point 3) before turning down to violate the previous
low at point 4. This trend reversal could have been identified simply
by watching the support and resistance levels. In our coverage of
price patterns, this type of reversal pattern will be identified as a
double top.

How Support and Resistance Levels Reverse Their
Roles
So far we've defined "support" as a previous low and "resistance" as a
previous high. However, this is not always the case. This leads us to
one of the more interesting and lesser known aspects of support and
resistance—their reversal of roles. Whenever a support or

This type of pattern is
called a double top.

resistance level is penetrated by a significant amount, they reverse their
roles and become the opposite. In other words, a resistance level
becomes a support level and support becomes resistance. To
understand why this occurs, perhaps it would be helpful to discuss
some of the psychology behind the creation of support and resistance
levels.
The Psychology of Support and Resistance
To illustrate, let's divide the market participants into three categories—the longs, the shorts, and the uncommitted. The longs are
those traders who have already purchased contracts; the shorts are
those who have already committed themselves to the sell side; the
uncommitted are those who have either gotten out of the market or
remain undecided as to which side to enter.
Let's assume that a market starts to move higher from a
support area where prices have been fluctuating for some time. The
longs (those who bought near the support area) are delighted, but
regret not having bought more. If the market would dip back near that
support area again, they could add to their long positions. The shorts
now realize (or strongly suspect) that they are on the wrong side of
the market. (How far the market has moved away from that support
area will greatly influence these decisions, but we'll come back to that
point a bit later.) The shorts are hoping (and praying) for a dip back
to that area where they went short so they can get out of the market
where they got in (their break even point).
Those sitting on the sidelines can be divided into two
groups—those who never had a position and those who, for one
reason or another, liquidated previously held long positions in the
support area. The latter group are, of course, mad at themselves for
liquidating their longs prematurely and are hoping for another chance
to reinstate those longs near where they sold them.
The final group, the undecided, now realize that prices are
going higher and resolve to enter the market on the long side on the
next good buying opportunity. All four groups are resolved to "buy
the next dip." They all have a "vested interest" in that sup-

www.Fxborssa.com

60

Chapter 4

port area under the market. Naturally, if prices do decline near that
support, renewed buying by all four groups will materialize to push
prices up.
The more trading that takes place in that support area, the
more significant it becomes because more participants have a vested
interest in that area. The amount of trading in a given support or
resistance area can be determined in three ways: the amount of time
spent there, volume, and how recently the trading took place.
The longer the period of time that prices trade in a support or
resistance area, the more significant that area becomes. For example,
if prices trade sideways for three weeks in a congestion area before
moving higher, that support area would be more important than if
only three days of trading had occurred.
Volume is another way to measure the significance of support
and resistance. If a support level is formed on heavy volume, this
would indicate that a large number of units changed hands, and
would mark that support level as more important than if very little
trading had taken place. Point and figure charts that measure the
intraday trading activity are especially useful in identifying these
price levels where most of the trading took place and, consequently,
where support and resistance will be most likely to function.
A third way to determine the significance of a support or resistance area is how recently the trading took place. Because we are dealing with the reaction of traders to market movement and to positions
that they have already taken or failed to take, it stands to reason that
the more recent the activity, the more potent it becomes.
Now let's turn the tables and imagine that, instead of moving
higher, prices move lower. In the previous example, because prices
advanced, the combined reaction of the market participants caused
each downside reaction to be met with additional buying (thereby
creating new support). However, if prices start to drop and move
below the previous support area, the reaction becomes just the
opposite. All those who bought in the support area now realize that
they made a mistake. For futures traders, their brokers are now
calling frantically for more margin money.

www.Fxborssa.com

Basic Concepts of Trend

61

Because of the highly leveraged nature of futures trading, traders
cannot sit with losses very long. They must put up additional margin
money or liquidate their losing positions.
What created the previous support in the first place was the
predominance of buy orders under the market. Now, however, all of
the previous buy orders under the market have become sell orders
over the market. Support has become resistance. And the more
significant that previous support area was—that is, the more recent
and the more trading that took place there—the more potent it now
becomes as a resistance area. All of the factors that created support
by the three categories of participants—the longs, the shorts, and the
uncommitted—will now function to put a ceiling over prices on
subsequent rallies or bounces.
It is useful once in a while to pause and reflect on why the
price patterns used by chartists, and concepts like support and
resistance, actually do work. It's not because of some magic produced
by the charts or some lines drawn on those charts. These patterns
work because they provide pictures of what the market participants
are actually doing and enable us to determine their reactions to
market events. Chart analysis is actually a study of human
psychology and the reactions of traders to changing market
conditions. Unfortunately, because we live in the fast-paced world of
financial markets, we tend to rely heavily on chart terminology and
shortcut expressions that overlook the underlying forces that created
the pictures on the charts in the first place. There are sound
psychological reasons why support and resistance levels can be
identified on price charts and why they can be used to help predict
market movements.
Support Becoming Resistance and Vice
Versa: Degree of Penetration
A support level, penetrated by a significant margin, becomes a
resistance level and vice versa. Figures 4.5a-c are similar to Figures
4.3a and b but with one added refinement. Notice that as prices are
rising in Figure 4.5a the reaction at point 4 stops at or above the top
of the peak at point 1. That previous peak at point 1 had been a
resistance level. But once it was decisively penetrated by

www.Fxborssa.com

62

Chapter 4

wave 3, that previous resistance peak became a support level. All of
the previous selling near the top of wave 1 (creating the resistance
level) has now become buying under the market. In Figure 4.5b,
showing declining prices, point 1 (which had been a previous support
level under the market) has now become a resistance level over the
market acting as a ceiling at point 4.
It was mentioned earlier that the distance prices traveled away
from support or resistance increased the significance of that support
or resistance. This is particularly true when support and resistance
levels are penetrated and reverse roles. For example, it was stated that
support and resistance levels reverse roles only after a significant
penetration. But what constitutes significant? There is quite a bit of
subjectivity involved here in determining whether a penetration is
significant or not. As a benchmark, some

www.Fxborssa.com

64

Chapter A

chartists use a 3% penetration as a criteria, particularly for major
support and resistance levels. Shorter term support and resistance
areas would probably require a much smaller number, like 1%. In
reality, each analyst must decide for himself or herself what constitutes a significant penetration. It's important to remember,
however, that support and resistance areas only reverse roles when
the market moves far enough away to convince the market
participants that they have made a mistake. The farther away the
market moves, the more convinced they become.
The Importance of Round Numbers as
Support and Resistance
There is a tendency for round numbers to stop advances or declines.
Traders tend to think in terms of important round numbers, such as
10, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100 (and multiples of 1000), as price objectives
and act accordingly. These round numbers, therefore, will often act
as "psychological" support or resistance levels. A trader can use this
information to begin taking profits as an important round number is
approached.
The gold market is an excellent example of this phenomenon.
The 1982 bear market low was right at $300. The market then rallied
to just above $500 in the first quarter of 1983 before falling to $400.
A gold rally in 1987 stopped at $500 again. From 1990 to 1997, gold
failed each attempt to break through $400. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average has shown a tendency to stall at multiples of 1000.
One trading application of this principle is to avoid placing
trading orders right at these obvious round numbers. For example, if
the trader is trying to buy into a short term market dip in an uptrend,
it would make sense to place limit orders just above an important
round number. Because others are trying to buy the market at the
round number, the market may never get there. Traders looking to
sell on a bounce should place resting sell orders just below round
numbers. The opposite would be true when placing protective stops
on existing positions. As a general rule, avoid placing protective stops
at obvious round numbers.

www.Fxborssa.com

65

Basic Concepts of Trend

In other words, protective stops on long positions should be
placed below round numbers and on short positions, above such
numbers. The tendency for markets to respect round numbers, and
especially the more important round numbers previously referred to,
is one of those peculiar market characteristics that can prove most
helpful in trading and should be kept in mind by the technically
oriented trader.

TRENDLINES
Now that we understand support and resistance, let's add another
building block to our arsenal of technical tools—the trendline. (See
Figures 4.6a-c.) The basic trendline is one of the simplest of the
technical tools employed by the chartist, but is also one of the most
valuable. An up trendline is a straight line drawn upward to the right
along successive reaction lows as shown by the solid line in Figure
4.6a. A down trendline is drawn downward to the right along
successive rally peaks as shown in Figure 4.6b.

Figure 4.6a
Example of an up trendline. The up trendline is

drawn under two successively higher lows (points

Drawing a Trendline
The correct drawing of trendlines is a lot like every other aspect of
charting and some experimenting with different lines is usually
necessary to find the correct one. Sometimes a trendline that looks
correct may have to be redrawn. But there are some useful guidelines
in the search for that correct line.
First of all, there must be evidence of a trend. This means
that, for an up trendline to be drawn, there must be at least two
reaction lows with the second low higher than the first. Of course, it
always takes two points to draw any straight line. In Figure 4.6a, for
example, only after prices have begun to move higher from point 3 is
the chartist reasonably confident that a reaction low has been formed,
and only then can a tentative up trendline be drawn under points 1
and 3.
Some chartists require that the peak at point 2 be penetrated
to confirm the uptrend before drawing the trendline. Others only
require a 50% retracement of wave 2-3, or that prices approach the
top of wave 2. While the criteria may differ, the main point to
remember is that the chartist wants to be reasonably sure that a
reaction low has been formed before identifying a valid reaction low.
Once two ascending lows have been identified, a straight line is
drawn connecting the lows and projected up and to the right.
Tentative Versus the Valid Trendline
So far, all we have is a tentative trendline. In order to confirm the
validity of a trendline, however, that line should be touched a third
time with prices bouncing off of it. Therefore, in Figure 4.6a, the
successful test of the up trendline at point 5 confirmed the validity of
that line. Figure 4.6b shows a downtrend, but the rules are the same.
The successful test of the trendline occurs at point 5. To summarize,
two points are needed to draw the trendline, and a third point to make
it a valid trendline.
How to Use the Trendline
Once the third point has been confirmed and the trend proceeds in its
original direction, that trendline becomes very useful in a

variety of ways. One of the basic concepts of trend is that a trend in
motion will tend to remain in motion. As a corollary to that, once a
trend assumes a certain slope or rate of speed, as identified by the
trendline, it will usually maintain the same slope. The trendline then
helps not only to determine the extremities of the corrective phases,
but maybe even more importantly, tells us when that trend is
changing.
In an uptrend, for example, the inevitable corrective dip will
often touch or come very close to the up trendline. Because the intent
of the trader is to buy dips in an uptrend, that trend-line provides a
support boundary under the market that can be used as a buying area.
A down trendline can be used as a resistance area for selling
purposes. (See Figures 4.7a and b.)
As long as the trendline is not violated, it can be used to
determine buying and selling areas. However, at point 9 in Figures
4.7a-b, the violation of the trendline signals a trend change, calling
for liquidation of all positions in the direction of the previous trend.
Very often, the breaking of the trendline is one of the best early warnings of
a change in trend.

Figure 4.7a Once the up trendline has been established, subsequent dips
near the line can be used as buying areas. Points 5 and 7 in this example could
have been used for new or additional longs. The breaking of the trendline at
point 9 called for liquidation of all longs by signaling a downside trend reversal.

How to Determine the Significance of a
Trendline
Let's discuss some of the refinements of the trendline. First, what
determines the significance of a trendline? The answer to that
question is twofold—the longer it has been intact and the number of
times it has been tested. A trendline that has been successfully tested
eight times, for example, that has continually demonstrated its
validity, is obviously a more significant trendline than one that has
only been touched three times. Also, a trendline that has been in effect
for nine months is of more importance than one that has been in effect
for nine weeks or nine days. The more significant the trendline, the
more confidence it inspires and the more important is its penetration.
Trendlines Should Include All Price Action
Trendlines on bar charts should be drawn over or under the entire
day's price range. Some chartists prefer to draw the trendline by
connecting only the closing prices, but that is not the more standard
procedure. The closing price may very well be the most important
price of the day, but it still represents only a small sample of that
day's activity. The technique of including the day's price range takes
into account all of the activity and is the more common usage. (See
Figure 4.8.)

drawing of a trendline

day's trading range.

How to Handle Small Trendline Penetrations
Sometimes prices will violate a trendline on an intraday basis, but
then close in the direction of the original trend, leaving the analyst in
some doubt as to whether or not the trendline has actually been
broken. (See Figure 4.9.) Figure 4.9 shows how such a situation might
look. Prices did dip under the trendline during the day, but closed
back above the up trendline. Should the trendline be redrawn?

Figure 4.9 Sometimes an intraday violation of a trendline will leave the
chartist in doubt as to whether the original trendline is still valid or if a new
line should be drawn. A compromise is to keep the original trendline, but draw a
new dotted line until it can be better determined which is the truer line.

Basic Concepts of Trend

71

Unfortunately, there's no hard and fast rule to follow in such a
situation. Sometimes it is best to ignore the minor breach, especially
if subsequent market action proves that the original line is still valid.
What Constitutes a Valid Breaking of a
Trendline?
As a general rule, a close beyond the trendline is more significant than
just an intraday penetration. To go a step further, sometimes even a
closing penetration is not enough. Most technicians employ a variety
of time and price filters in an attempt to isolate valid trendline
penetrations and eliminate bad signals or "whipsaws." One example
of a price filter is the 3% penetration criteria. This price filter is used
mainly for the breaking of longer term trend-lines, but requires that
the trendline be broken, on a closing basis, by at least 3%. (The 3%
rule doesn't apply to some financial futures, such as the interest rate
markets.)
If, for example, gold prices broke a major up trendline at
$400, prices would have to close below that line by 3% of the price
level where the line was broken (in this case, prices would have to
close $12 below the trendline, or at $388). Obviously, a $12
penetration criteria would not be appropriate for shorter term trading.
Perhaps a 1% criterion would serve better in such cases. The % rule
represents just one type of price filter. Stock chartists, for example,
might require a full point penetration and ignore fractional moves.
There is tradeoff involved in the use of any type of filter. If the filter
is too small, it won't be very useful in reducing the impact of
whipsaws. If it's too big, then much of the initial move will be missed
before a valid signal is given. Here again, the trader must determine
what type of filter is best suited to the degree of trend being followed,
always making allowances for the differences in the individuals
markets.
An alternative to a price filter (requiring that a trendline be
broken by some predetermined price increment or percentage
amount) is a time filter. A common time filter is the two day rule. In
other words, to have a valid breaking of a trendline, prices must close
beyond the trendline for two successive days. To break

www.Fxborssa.com

72

Chapter 4

an up trendline, therefore, prices must close under the trendline two
days in a row. A one day violation would not count. The 1-3% rule
and the two day rule are also applied to the breaking of important
support and resistance levels, not just to major trend-lines. Another
filter would require a Friday close beyond a major breakout point to
ensure a weekly signal.
How Trendlines Reverse Roles
It was mentioned earlier that support and resistance levels became the
opposite once violated. The same principle holds true of trendlines.
(See Figures 4.10a-c.) In other words, an up trendline (a support line)
will usually become a resistance line once it's decisively broken. A
down trendline (a resistance line) will often become a support line
once it's decisively broken. This is why it's usually a good idea to
project all trendlines as far out to the right on the chart as possible
even after they've been broken. It's surprising how often old
trendlines act as support and resistance lines again in the future, but
in the opposite role.
Measuring Implications of Trendlines
Trendlines can be used to help determine price objectives. We'll have
a lot more to say about price objectives in the next two chap-

Chapter 4

ters on price patterns. In fact, some of the price objectives addressed
that are derived from various price patterns are similar to the one
we'll cover here with trendlines. Stated briefly, once a trendline is
broken, prices will usually move a distance beyond the trendline
equal to the vertical distance that prices achieved on the other side of
the line, prior to the trend reversal.
In other words, if in the prior uptrend, prices moved $50
above the up trendline (measured vertically), then prices would be
expected to drop that same $50 below the trendline after it's broken.
In the next chapter, for example, we'll see that this measuring rule
using the trendline is similar to that used for the well-known head
and shoulders reversal pattern, where the distance from the "head" to
the "neckline" is projected beyond that line once it's broken.

THE FAN PRINCIPLE
This brings us to another interesting use of the trendline—the fan
principle. (See Figures 4.11a-c.) Sometimes after the violation of an
up trendline, prices will decline a bit before rallying back to the
bottom of the old up trendline (now a resistance line). In Figure
4.11a, notice how prices rallied to but failed to penetrate line 1. A

second trendline (line 2) can now be drawn, which is also broken.
After another failed rally attempt, a third line is drawn (line 3). The
breaking of that third trendline is usually an indication that prices are
headed lower. In Figure 4.11b, the breaking of the third down
trendline (line 3) constitutes a new uptrend signal. Notice in these
examples how previously broken support lines became resistance and
resistance lines became support. The term "fan principle" derives
from the appearance of the lines that gradually flatten out, resembling
a fan. The important point to remember here is that the breaking of
the third line is the valid trend reversal signal.

THE IMPORTANCE OF THE
NUMBER THREE
In examining the three lines in the fan principle, it's interesting to
note how often the number three shows up in the study of technical
analysis and the important role it plays in so many technical
approaches. For example, the fan principle uses three lines; major
bull and bear markets usually have three major phases (Dow Theory
and Elliott Wave Theory); there are three kinds of gaps (to be
covered shortly); some of the more commonly known reversal
patterns, such as the triple top and the head and shoulders, have three
prominent peaks; there are three different classifications of trend
(major, secondary, and minor) and three trend directions (up, down,
and sideways); among the generally accepted continuation patterns,
there are three types of triangles—the symmetrical, ascending, and
descending; there are three principle sources of information—price,
volume, and open interest. For whatever the reason, the number three
plays a very prominent role throughout the entire field of technical
analysis.

THE RELATIVE STEEPNESS OF
THE TRENDLINE
The relative steepness of the trendline is also important. In general,
most important up trendlines tend to approximate an average slope of
45 degrees. Some chartists simply draw a 45 degree

www.Fxborssa.com

Basic Concepts of Trend

77
Figure 4.12 Most valid
trendlines rise at an angle
approximating 45
degrees (see line 2). If the
trendline is too steep (line
1), it usually indicates
that the rate of ascent is
not sustainable. A trendline that is too flat (line
3) suggests that the
uptrend is too weak and

technicians use 45 degree

or bottoms as major
trendlines.

line on the chart from a prominent high or low and use this as a major
trendline. The 45 degree line was one of the techniques favored by
W. D. Gann. Such a line reflects a situation where prices are
advancing or declining at such a rate that price and time are in perfect
balance.
If a trendline is too steep (see line 1 in Figure 4.12), it usually
indicates that prices are advancing too rapidly and that the current
steep ascent will not be sustained. The breaking of that steep
trendline may be just a reaction back to a more sustainable slope
closer to the 45 degree line (line 2). If a trendline is too flat (see line
3), it may indicate that the uptrend is too weak and not to be trusted.
How to Adjust Trendlines
Sometimes trendlines have to be adjusted to fit a slowing or an
accelerating trend. (See Figure 4.13 and Figures 4.14a and b.) For
example, as shown in the previous case, if a steep trendline is broken,
a slower trendline might have to be drawn. If the original trendline is
too flat, it may have to be redrawn at a steeper angle. Figure 4.13
shows a situation where the breaking of the steeper trendline (line 1)
necessitated the drawing of a slower line (line 2).

www.Fxborssa.com

78

Chapter 4

Figure 4.13 Example of
a trendline that is too steep
(line 1). The original up
trendline proved too steep.
Often the breaking of a
steep trendline is only an
adjustment to a slower and
more sustainable up trendline (line 2).

In Figure 4.14a, the original trendline (line 1) is too flat and
has to be redrawn at a steeper angle (line 2). The uptrend accelerated,
requiring a steeper line. A trendline that is too far away from the
price action is obviously of little use in tracking the trend.
In the case of an accelerating trend, sometimes several
trendlines may have to be drawn at increasingly steeper angles. In my
experience, however, where steeper trendlines become necessary, it
is best to resort to another tool—the moving average— which is the
same as a curvilinear trendline. One of the advantages

of having access to several different types of technical indicators is
being able to choose the one most appropriate for a given situation.
All of the techniques covered in this book work well in certain situations, but not so well in others. By having an arsenal of tools to fall
back on, the technician can quickly switch from one tool to another
that might work better in a given situation. An accelerated trend is
one of those cases where a moving average would be more useful
than a series of steeper and steeper trendlines.
Just as there are several different degrees of trend in effect at
any one time, so is there a need for different trendlines to measure
those various trends. A major up trendline, for example, would
connect the low points of the major uptrend, while a shorter and more
sensitive line might be used for secondary swings. An even shorter
line can measure the short term movements. (See Figure 4.15.)

www.Fxborssa.com

80

Chapter 4

Figure 4.15 Different trendlines are used to define the different degrees of
trend. Line 1 in the above example is the major up trendline, defining the
major uptrend. Lines 2, 3, and 4 define the intermediate uptrends. Finally, line
5 defines a shorter term advance within the last intermediate uptrend.
Technicians use many different trendlines on the same chart.

THE CHANNEL LINE
The channel line, or the return line as it is sometimes called, is
another useful variation of the trendline technique. Sometimes prices
trend between two parallel lines—the basic trendline and the channel
line. Obviously, when this is the case and when the analyst
recognizes that a channel exists, this knowledge can be used to
profitable advantage.
The drawing of the channel line is relatively simple. In an
uptrend (see Figure 4.16a), first draw the basic up trendline along

the lows. Then draw a dotted line from the first prominent peak (point
2), which is parallel to the basic up trendline. Both lines move up to
the right, forming a channel. If the next rally reaches and backs off
from the channel line (at point 4), then a channel may exist. If prices
then drop back to the original trendline (at point 5), then a channel
probably does exist. The same holds true for a downtrend (Figure
4.16b), but of course in the opposite direction.

82

Chapter 4

Figure 4.16c Notice how prices fluctuated between the upper and lower
parallel channels over a period of 25 years. The 1987, 1989, and 1993 tops
occurred right at the upper channel line. The 1994 bottom bounced off the
lower trendline.

The reader should immediately see the value of such a situation. The basic up trendline can be used for the initiation of new
long positions. The channel line can be used for short term profit
taking. More aggressive traders might even use the channel line to
initiate a countertrend short position, although trading in the opposite
direction of the prevailing trend can be a dangerous and usually
costly tactic. As in the case of the basic trendline, the longer the
channel remains intact and the more often it is successfully tested, the
more important and reliable it becomes.
The breaking of the major trendline indicates an important
change in trend. But the breaking of a rising channel line has exactly
the opposite meaning, and signals an acceleration of the existing
trend. Some traders view the clearing of the upper line in an uptrend
as a reason to add to long positions.

Basic Concepts of Trend

Figure 4.17
The failure to reach the
upper end of the
channel is often an
early warning that the
lower line will be
broken. Notice the
failure to reach the
upper line at point 5 is
followed by the
breaking of the basic up
trend-line at point 6.

Another way to use the channel technique is to spot failures to
reach the channel line, usually a sign of a weakening trend. In Figure
4.17, the failure of prices to reach the top of the channel (at point 5)
may be an early warning that the trend is turning, and increases the
odds that the other line (the basic up trendline) will be broken. As a
general rule of thumb, the failure of any move within an established
price channel to reach one side of the channel usually indicates that
the trend is shifting, and increases the likelihood that the other side of
the channel will be broken.
The channel can also be used to adjust the basic trendline.
(See Figures 4.18 and 4.19.) If prices move above a projected rising
channel line by a significant amount, it usually indicates a
strengthening trend. Some chartists then draw a steeper basic up
trendline from the last reaction low parallel to the new channel line
(as demonstrated in Figure 4.18). Often, the new steeper support line
functions better than the old flatter line. Similarly, the failure of an
uptrend to reach the upper end of a channel justifies the drawing of a
new support line under the last reaction low parallel to the new
resistance line over the past two peaks (as shown in Figure 4.19).

Channel lines have measuring implications. Once a breakout
occurs from an existing price channel, prices usually travel a distance
equal to the width of the channel. Therefore, the user has to simply
measure the width of the channel and then project that amount from
the point at which either trendline is broken.
It should always be kept in mind, however, that of the two
lines, the basic trendline is by far the more important and the more
reliable. The channel line is a secondary use of the trendline
technique. But the use of the channel line works often enough to
justify its inclusion in the chartist's toolkit.

PERCENTAGE RETRACEMENTS
In all of the previous examples of uptrends and downtrends, the
reader has no doubt noticed that after a particular market move,
prices retrace a portion of the previous trend before resuming the
move in the original direction. These countertrend moves tend to fall
into certain predictable percentage parameters. The best known
application of the phenomenon is the 50% retracement. Let's say, for
example, that a market is trending higher and travels from the 100
level to the 200 level. Very often, the subsequent reaction retraces
about half of the prior move, to about the 150 level, before upward
momentum is regained. This is a very well-known market tendency
and happens quite frequently. Also, these percentage retracements
apply to any degree of trend— major, secondary, and near term.
Besides the 50% retracement, there are minimum and maximum percentage parameters that are also widely recognized—the
one-third and the two-thirds retracements. In other words, the price
trend can be divided into thirds. Usually, a minimum retracement is
about 33% and a maximum about 66%. What this means is that, in a
correction of a strong trend, the market usually retraces at least a third
of the previous move. This is very useful information for a number of
reasons. If a trader is looking for a buying area under the market, he
or she can just compute a 33-50% zone on the chart and use that price
zone as a general frame of reference for buying opportunities. (See
Figures 4.20a and b.)

Figure 4.20a Prices often retrace about half of the prior trend before
resuming in the original direction. This example shows a 50% retracement.
The minimum retracement is one-third and the maximum, two-thirds of the
prior trend.

The maximum retracement parameter is 66%, which becomes
an especially critical area. If the prior trend is to be maintained, the
correction must stop at the two-thirds point. This then becomes a
relatively low risk buying area in an uptrend or selling area in a
downtrend. If prices move beyond the two-thirds point, the odds then
favor a trend reversal rather than just a retracement. The move
usually then retraces the entire 100% of the prior trend.
You may have noticed that the three percentage retracement
parameters we've mentioned so far—50%, 33%, and 66%— are
taken right from the original Dow Theory. When we get to the Elliott
Wave Theory and Fibonacci ratios, we will see that followers of that
approach use percentage retracements of 38% and 62%. I prefer to
combine both approaches for a minimum retracement zone of 3338% and a maximum zone of 62-66%. Some technicians round off
these numbers even further to arrive at a 40-60% retracement zone.

Basic Concepts of Trend

87

Figure 4.20b The three horizontal lines mark the 38%, 50%, and 62%
retracement levels measured from the April 1997 low to the August high. The
first decline fell to the 38% line, the second decline to the 62% line, and the
third near the 50% line. Most corrections will find support in the 38% to
50% retracement zones. The 38% and 62% lines are Fibonacci retracements
and are popular with chartists.

Students of W. D. Gann are aware that he broke down the
trend structure into eighths—V8, 2/8, 3/8, 4/8, 5/8, 6/8, 7/8, 8/8. However,
even Gann attached special importance to the 3/8 (38%), 4/8 (50%),
and 5/8 (62%) retracement numbers and also felt it was important to
divide the trend into thirds—1/3 (33%) and 2/3 (66%).

SPEED RESISTANCE LINES
Speaking of thirds, let's touch on another technique that combines the
trendline with percentage retracements—speedlines. This technique,
developed by Edson Gould, is actually an adaptation

www.Fxborssa.com

88

Chapter 4

of the idea of dividing the trend into thirds. The main difference from
the percentage retracement concept is that the speed resistance lines
(or speedlines) measure the rate of ascent or descent of a trend (in
other words, its speed).
To construct a bullish speedline, find the highest point in the
current uptrend. (See Figure 4.21a.) From that high point on the
chart, a vertical line is drawn toward the bottom of the chart to where
the trend began. That vertical line is then divided into thirds. A
trendline is then drawn from the beginning of the trend through the
two points marked off on the vertical line, representing the one-third
and two-thirds points. In a downtrend, just reverse the process.
Measure the vertical distance from the low point in the downtrend to
the beginning of the trend, and draw two lines from the beginning of
the trend through the one-third and two-thirds points on the vertical
line. (See Figures 4.21a and b.)

Figure 4.21a Examples of speed resistance lines in an uptrend. The vertical
distance from the peak to the beginning of the trend is divided into thirds. Two
trendlines are then drawn from point 1 through points 2 and 3. The upper line is
the 2/3 speedline and the lower, the 1/3. The lines should act as support during
market corrections. When they're broken, they revert to resistance lines on
bounces. Sometimes these speedlines intersect price action.

www.Fxborssa.com

Basic Concepts of Trend

89

Figure 4.21b Speedlines in a downtrend.
Each time a new high is set in an uptrend or a new low in a
downtrend, a new set of lines must be drawn (because there is now a
new high or low point). Because the speedlines are drawn from the
beginning of the trend to the one-third and two-thirds points, those
trendlines may sometimes move through some of the price action.
This is one case where trend-lines are not drawn under lows or over
highs, but actually through the price action.
If an uptrend is in the process of correcting itself, the
downside correction will usually stop at the higher speedline (the 2/3
speedline). If not, prices will drop to the lower speedline (the V3
speedline). If the lower line is also broken, prices will probably
continue all the way to the beginning of the prior trend. In a
downtrend, the breaking of the lower line indicates a probable rally to
the higher line. If that is broken, a rally to the top of the prior trend
would be indicated.
As with all trendlines, speedlines reverse roles once they are
broken. Therefore, during the correction of an uptrend, if the upper
line (2/3 line) is broken and prices fall to the 1/3 line and rally from
there, that upper line becomes a resistance barrier. Only when that
upper line is broken would a signal be given that the old highs will
probably be challenged. The same principle holds true in downtrends.

Chapter 4

GANN AND FIBONACCI FAN LINES
Charting software also allows the drawing of Gann and Fibonacci
fan lines. Fibonacci fan lines are drawn in the same fashion as the
speedline. Except that Fibonacci lines are drawn at 38% and 62%
angles. (We'll explain where those 38% and 62% numbers come from
in Chapter 13, "Elliott Wave Theory.") Gann lines (named after the
legendary commodity trader, W.D. Gann) are trendlines drawn from
prominent tops or bottoms at specific geometric angles. The most
important Gann line is drawn at a 45 degree angle from a peak or
trough. Steeper Gann lines can be drawn during an uptrend at 633/4
degree and 75 degree angles. Flatter Gann lines can be drawn at 26V4
and 15 degree lines. It's possible to draw as many as nine different
Gann lines.
Gann and Fibonacci lines are used in the same way as
speedlines. They are supposed to provide support during downward
corrections. When one line is broken, prices will usually fall to the
next lower line. Gann lines are somewhat controversial. Even if one
of them works, you can't be sure in advance which one it will be.
Some chartists question the validity of drawing geometric trendlines
at all.

INTERNAL TRENDLINES
These are variations of the trendline that don't rely on extreme highs
or lows. Instead, internal trendlines are drawn through the price
action and connect as many internal peaks or troughs as possible.
Some chartists develop a good eye for this type of trend-line and find
them useful. The problem with internal trendlines is that their
drawing is very subjective; whereas the rules for drawing of more
traditional trendlines along the extreme highs and lows are more
exact. (See Figure 4.21c.)

REVERSAL DAYS
Another important building block is the reversal day. This particular
chart formation goes by many names—the top reversal day,

the bottom reversal day, the buying or selling climax, and the key
reversal day. By itself, this formation is not of major importance. But,
taken in the context of other technical information, it can sometimes
be significant. Let's first define what a reversal day is.
A reversal day takes place either at a top or a bottom. The
generally accepted definition of a top reversal day is the setting of a
new high in an uptrend, followed by a lower close on the same day.
In other words, prices set a new high for a given upmove at some
point during the day (usually at or near the opening) then weaken and
actually close lower than the previous day's closing. A bottom
reversal day would be a new low during the day followed by a higher
close.
The wider the range for the day and the heavier the volume,
the more significant is the signal for a possible near term

Chapter 4

trend reversal. Figures 4.22a-b show what both would look like on a
bar chart. Note the heavier volume on the reversal day. Also notice
that both the high and low on the reversal day exceed the range of the
previous day, forming an outside day. While an outside day is not a
requirement for a reversal day, it does carry more significance. (See
Figure 4.22c.)
The bottom reversal day is sometimes referred to as a selling
climax. This is usually a dramatic turnaround at the bottom of a down
move where all the discouraged longs have finally been forced out of
the market on heavy volume. The subsequent absence of selling
pressure creates a vacuum over the market, which prices quickly rally
to fill. The selling climax is one of the more dramatic examples of the
reversal day and, while it may not mark the final bottom of a falling
market, it usually signals that a significant low has been seen.

top reversal day. The heavier
the volume on the reversal day
and the wider the range, the
more important it becomes.

Figure 4.22c The chart action of October 28, 1997 was a classic example
of an upside reversal day or a "selling climax." Prices opened sharply lower
and closed sharply higher. The unusually heavy volume bar for that day
added to its importance. Two less dramatic upside reversal days (see arrows)
also marked price bottoms.

Weekly and Monthly Reversals
This type of reversal pattern shows up on weekly and monthly bar
charts, and with much greater significance. On a weekly chart, each
bar represents the entire week's range with the close registered on
Friday. An upside weekly reversal, therefore, would occur when the
market trades lower during the week, makes a new low for the move,
but on Friday closes above the previous Friday's close.
Weekly reversals are much more significant than daily
reversals for obvious reasons and are watched closely by chartists as
signaling important turning points. By the same token, monthly
reversals are even more important.

Chapter 4

PRICE GAPS
Price gaps are simply areas on the bar chart where no trading has
taken place. In an uptrend, for example, prices open above the
highest price of the previous day, leaving a gap or open space on the
chart that is not filled during the day. In a downtrend, the day's
highest price is below the previous day's low. Upside gaps are signs
of market strength, while downside gaps are usually signs of
weakness. Gaps can appear on long term weekly and monthly charts
and, when they do, are usually very significant. But they are more
commonly seen on daily bar charts.
Several myths exist concerning the interpretation of gaps.
One of the maxims often heard is that "gaps are always filled." This
is simply not true. Some should be filled and others shouldn't. We'll
also see that gaps have different forecasting implications depending
on which types they are and where they occur.
Three Types of Gaps
There are three general types of gaps—the breakaway, runaway (or
measuring), and exhaustion gaps.
The Breakaway Gap. The breakaway gap usually occurs at the
completion of an important price pattern, and usually signals the
beginning of a significant market move. After a market has completed a major basing pattern, the breaking of resistance often occurs
on a breakaway gap. Major breakouts from topping or basing areas
are breeding grounds for this type of gap. The breaking of a major
trendline, signaling a reversal of trend, might also see a breakaway
gap.
Breakaway gaps usually occur on heavy volume. More often
than not, breakaway gaps are not filled. Prices may return to the
upper end of the gap (in the case of a bullish breakout), and may even
close a portion of the gap, but some portion of the gap is often left
unfilled. As a rule, the heavier the volume after such a gap appears,
the less likely it is to be filled. Upside gaps usually act as support areas
on subsequent market corrections. It's important that prices not fall
below gaps during an uptrend. In all cases a close below an upward
gap is a sign of weakness. (See Figures 4.23a and b.)

midway point (which is why it is also called the measuring gap). An exhaustion gap to the upside, followed within a week by a breakaway gap to the
downside, left an island reversal top. Notice that the breakaway and runaway gaps were not filled on the way up, which is often the case.

The Runaway or Measuring Gap. After the move has been underway
for awhile, somewhere around the middle of the move, prices will
leap forward to form a second type of gap (or a series of gaps) called
the runaway gap. This type of gap reveals a situation where the
market is moving effortlessly on moderate volume. In an uptrend, it's
a sign of market strength; in a downtrend, a sign of weakness. Here
again, runaway gaps act as support under the market on subsequent
corrections and are often not filled. As in the case of the breakaway, a
close below the runaway gap is a negative sign in an uptrend.

Figure 4.23b 77/e first box shows an "exhaustion" gap near the end of the
rally. Prices falling below that gap signaled a top. The second box is a
"measuring" gap about halfway through the downtrend. The third box is
another "exhaustion" gap at the bottom. The move back above that gap signaled higher prices.

This variety of gap is also called a measuring gap because it
usually occurs at about the halfway point in a trend. By measuring
the distance the trend has already traveled, from the original trend
signal or breakout, an estimate of the probable extent of the
remaining move can be determined by doubling the amount already
achieved.
The Exhaustion Gap. The final type of gap appears near the end of a
market move. After all objectives have been achieved and the other
two types of gaps (breakaway and runaway) have been identified, the
analyst should begin to expect the exhaustion gap. Near the end of an
uptrend, prices leap forward in a last gasp, so to speak. However, that
upward leap quickly fades and prices turn lower within a couple of
days or within a week. When prices close

www.Fxborssa.com

97

Basic Concepts of Trend

under that last gap, it is usually a dead giveaway that the exhaustion
gap has made its appearance. This is a classic example where falling
below a gap in an uptrend has very bearish implications.
The Island Reversal
This takes us to the island reversal pattern. Sometimes after the
upward exhaustion gap has formed, prices will trade in a narrow
range for a couple of days or a couple of weeks before gapping to the
downside. Such a situation leaves the few days of price action
looking like an "island" surrounded by space or water. The exhaustion gap to the upside followed by a breakaway gap to the downside
completes the island reversal pattern and usually indicates a trend
reversal of some magnitude. Of course, the major significance of the
reversal depends on where prices are in the general trend structure.

CONCLUSION
This chapter introduced introductory technical tools that I consider to
be the building blocks of chart analysis—support and resistance,
trendlines and channels, percentage retracements, speed resistance
lines, reversal days, and gaps. Every technical approach covered in
later chapters uses these concepts and tools in one form or another.
Armed with a better understanding of these concepts, we're now
ready to begin a study of price patterns.

Major Reversal Patterns

INTRODUCTION
So far we've touched on Dow Theory, which is the basis of most
trend following work being used today. We've examined the basic
concepts of trend, such as support, resistance, and trendlines. And
we've introduced volume and open interest. We're now ready to
take the next step, which is a study of chart patterns. You'll quickly see that these patterns build on the previous concepts.
In Chapter 4, the definition of a trend was given as a series
of ascending or descending peaks and troughs. As long as they
were ascending, the trend was up; if they were descending, the
trend was down. It was stressed, however, that markets also move
sideways for a certain portion of the time. It is these periods of
sideways market movement that will concern us most in these
next two chapters.
It would be a mistake to assume that most changes in
trend are very abrupt affairs. The fact is that important changes in
trend usually require a period of transition. The problem is that

99

www.Fxborssa.com

700

Chapter 5

these periods of transition do not always signal a trend reversal.
Sometimes these sideways periods just indicate a pause or consolidation in the existing trend after which the original trend is resumed.

PRICE PATTERNS
The study of these transition periods and their forecasting implications leads us to the question of price patterns. First of all, what are
price patterns? Price patterns are pictures or formations, which
appear on price charts of stocks or commodities, that can be classified into different categories, and that have predictive value.

TWO TYPES OF PATTERNS:
REVERSAL AND CONTINUATION
There are two major categories of price patterns—reversal and
continuation. As these names imply, reversal patterns indicate that an
important reversal in trend is taking place. The continuation patterns,
on the other hand, suggest that the market is only pausing for awhile,
possibly to correct a near term overbought or oversold condition,
after which the existing trend will be resumed. The trick is to
distinguish between the two types of patterns as early as possible
during the formation of the pattern.
In this chapter, we'll be examining the five most commonly
used major reversal patterns: the head and shoulders, triple tops and
bottoms, double tops and bottoms, spike (or V) tops and bottoms, and
the rounding (or saucer) pattern. We will examine the price formation
itself, how it is formed on the chart, and how it can be identified. We
will then look at the other important considerations—the
accompanying volume pattern and measuring implications.
Volume plays an important confirming role in all of these
price patterns. In times of doubt (and there are lots of those), a study
of the volume pattern accompanying the price data can be the
deciding factor as to whether or not the pattern can be trusted.

www.Fxborssa.com

Major Reversal Patterns

101

Most price patterns also have certain measuring techniques
that help the analyst to determine minimum price objectives. While
these objectives are only an approximation of the size of the
subsequent move, they are helpful in assisting the trader to determine
his or her reward to risk ratio.
In Chapter 5, we'll look at a second category of patterns— the
continuation variety. There we will examine triangles, flags,
pennants, wedges, and rectangles. These patterns usually reflect
pauses in the existing trend rather than trend reversals, and are
usually classified as intermediate and minor as opposed to major.
Preliminary Points Common to All
Reversal Patterns
Before beginning our discussion of the individual major reversal
patterns, there are a few preliminary points to be considered that are
common to all of these reversal patterns.
1. A prerequisite for any reversal pattern is the existence of a prior
trend.
2. The first signal of an impending trend reversal is often the
breaking of an important trendline.
3. The larger the pattern, the greater the subsequent move.
4. Topping patterns are usually shorter in duration and more volatile
than bottoms.
5. Bottoms usually have smaller price ranges and take longer to
build.
6. Volume is usually more important on the upside.
The Need for a Prior Trend. The existence of a prior major trend is an
important prerequisite for any reversal pattern. A market must
obviously have something to reverse. A formation occasionally
appears on the charts, resembling one of the reversal patterns. If that
pattern, however, has not been preceded by a trend, there is nothing
to reverse and the pattern is suspect. Knowing where certain patterns
are most apt to occur in the trend structure is one of the key elements
in pattern recognition.

www.Fxborssa.com

102

Chapter 5

A corollary to this point of having a prior trend to reverse is
the matter of measuring implications. It was stated earlier that most
of the measuring techniques give only minimum price objectives. The
maximum objective would be the total extent of the prior move. If a
major bull market has occurred and a major topping pattern is being
formed, the maximum implication for the potential move to the
downside would be a 100% retracement of the bull market, or the
point at which it all began.
The Breaking of Important Trendlines. The first sign of an impending
trend reversal is often the breaking of an important trendline.
Remember, however, that the violation of a major trendline does not
necessarily signal a trend reversal. What is being signaled is a change
in trend. The breaking of a major up trendline might signal the
beginning of a sideways price pattern, which later would be
identified as either the reversal or consolidation type. Sometimes the
breaking of the major trendline coincides with the completion of the
price pattern.
The Larger the Pattern, the Greater the Potential. When we use the
term "larger," we are referring to the height and the width of the price
pattern. The height measures the volatility of the pattern. The width
is the amount of time required to build and complete the pattern. The
greater the size of the pattern—that is, the wider the price swings
within the pattern (the volatility) and the longer it takes to build—the
more important the pattern becomes and the greater the potential for
the ensuing price move.
Virtually all of the measuring techniques in these two
chapters are based on the height of the pattern. This is the method
applied primarily to bar charts, which use a vertical measuring criteria. The practice of measuring the horizontal width of a price pattern usually is reserved for point and figure charting. That method of
charting uses a device known as the count, which assumes a close
relationship between the width of a top or bottom and the subsequent
price target.
Differences Between Tops and Bottoms. Topping patterns are usually
shorter in duration and are more volatile than bottoms. Price swings
within the tops are wider and more violent. Tops usually take less
time to form. Bottoms usually have smaller price ranges,

www.Fxborssa.com

Major Reversal Patterns

103

but take longer to build. For this reason it is usually easier and less
costly to identify and trade bottoms than to catch market tops. One
consoling factor, which makes the more treacherous topping patterns
worthwhile, is that prices tend to decline faster than they go up.
Therefore, the trader can usually make more money a lot faster by
catching the short side of a bear market than by trading the long side
of a bull market. Everything in life is a tradeoff between reward and
risk. The greater risks are compensated for by greater rewards and
vice versa. Topping patterns are harder to catch, but are worth the
effort.
Volume is More Important on the Upside. Volume should generally
increase in the direction of the market trend and is an important
confirming factor in the completion of all price patterns. The
completion of each pattern should be accompanied by a noticeable
increase in volume. However, in the early stages of a trend reversal,
volume is not as important at market tops. Markets have a way of
"falling of their own weight" once a bear move gets underway.
Chartists like to see an increase in trading activity as prices drop, but
it is not critical. At bottoms, however, the volume pickup is
absolutely essential. If the volume pattern does not show a significant
increase during the upside price breakout, the entire price pattern
should be questioned. We will be taking a more in-depth look at
volume in Chapter 7.

THE HEAD AND SHOULDERS
REVERSAL PATTERN
Let's take a close look now at what is probably the best known and
most reliable of all major reversal patterns—the head and shoulders
reversal. We'll spend more time on this pattern because it is important and also to explain all the nuances involved. Most of the other
reversal patterns are just variations of the head and shoulders and will
not require as extensive a treatment.
This major reversal pattern, like all of the others, is just a
further refinement of the concepts of trend covered in Chapter 4.
Picture a situation in a major uptrend, where a series of ascending
peaks and troughs gradually begin to lose momentum. The

www.Fxborssa.com

104

Chapter 5

uptrend then levels off for awhile. During this time the forces of
supply and demand are in relative balance. Once this distribution
phase has been completed, support levels along the bottom of the
horizontal trading range are broken and a new downtrend has been
established. That new downtrend now has descending peaks and
troughs.
Let's see how this scenario would look on a head and shoulders top. (See Figures 5.1a and b.) At point A, the uptrend is proceeding as expected with no signs of a top. Volume expands on the
price move into new highs, which is normal. The corrective

Figure 5.1a Example of a head and shoulders top. The left and right
shoulders (A and E) are at about the same height. The head (C) is higher than
either shoulder. Notice the lighter volume on each peak. The pattern is
completed on a close under the neckline (line 2). The minimum objective is
the vertical distance from the head to the neckline projected downward pom
the breaking of the neckline. A return move will often occur back to the neckline, which should not recross the neckline once it has been broken.

dip to point B is on lighter volume, which is also to be expected. At
point C, however, the alert chartist might notice that the volume on
the upside breakout through point A is a bit lighter than on the
previous rally. This change is not in itself of major importance, but a
little yellow caution light goes on in the back of the analyst's head.
Prices then begin to decline to point D and something even
more disturbing happens. The decline carries below the top of the
previous peak at point A. Remember that, in an uptrend, a penetrated
peak should function as support on subsequent corrections. The
decline well under point A, almost to the previous reaction low at
point B, is another warning that something may be going wrong with
the uptrend.
The market rallies again to point E, this time on even lighter
volume, and isn't able to reach the top of the previous

706

Chapter 5

peak at point C. (That last rally at point E will often retrace one-half
to two-thirds of the decline from points C to D.) To continue an
uptrend, each high point must exceed the high point of the rally
preceding it. The failure of the rally at point E to reach the previous
peak at point C fulfills half of the requirement for a new
downtrend—namely, descending peaks.
By this time, the major up trendline (line 1) has already been
broken, usually at point D, constituting another danger signal. But,
despite all of these warnings, all that we know at this point is that the
trend has shifted from up to sideways. This might be sufficient cause
to liquidate long positions, but not necessarily enough to justify new
short sales.
The Breaking of the Neckline
Completes the Pattern
By this time, a flatter trendline can be drawn under the last two
reaction lows (points B and D), which is called a neckline (see line
2). This line generally has a slight upward slope at tops (although it's
sometimes horizontal and, less often, tilts downward). The deciding
factor in the resolution of the head and shoulders top is a decisive
closing violation of that neckline. The market has now violated the
trendline along the bottom of points B and D, has broken under
support at point D, and has completed the requirement for a new
downtrend—descending peaks and troughs. The new downtrend is
now identified by the declining highs and lows at points C, D, E, and
R Volume should increase on the breaking of the neckline. A sharp
increase in downside volume, however, is not critically important in
the initial stages of a market top.
The Return Move
Usually a return move develops which is a bounce back to the bottom
of the neckline or to the previous reaction low at point D (see point
G), both of which have now become overhead resistance. The return
move does not always occur or is sometimes only a very minor
bounce. Volume may help determine the size of the bounce. If the
initial breaking of the neckline is on very heavy trading, the odds for
a return move are diminished because the

www.Fxborssa.com

Major Reversal Patterns

107

increased activity reflects greater downside pressure. Lighter volume on the initial break of the neckline increases the likelihood
of a return move. That bounce, however, should be on light volume and the subsequent resumption of the new downtrend
should be accompanied by noticeably heavier trading activity.
Summary
Let's review the basic ingredients for a head and shoulders top.
1. A prior uptrend.
2. A left shoulder on heavier volume (point A) followed by a
corrective dip to point B.
3. A rally into new highs but on lighter volume (point C).
4. A decline that moves below the previous peak (at A) and
approaches the previous reaction low (point D).
5. A third rally (point E) on noticeably light volume that fails to
reach the top of the head (at point C).
6. A close below the neckline.
7. A return move back to the neckline (point G) followed by
new lows.
What has become evident is three well defined peaks. The
middle peak (the head) is slightly higher than either of the two
shoulders (points A and E). The pattern, however, is not complete
until the neckline is decisively broken on a closing basis. Here
again, the 1-3% penetration criterion (or some variation thereof)
or the requirement of two successive closes below the neckline
(the two day rule) can be used for added confirmation. Until that
downside violation takes place, however, there is always the possibility that the pattern is not really a head and shoulders top and
that the uptrend may resume at some point.

THE IMPORTANCE OF VOLUME
The accompanying volume pattern plays an important role in the
development of the head and shoulders top as it does in all price

www.Fxborssa.com

108

Chapter 5

patterns. As a general rule, the second peak (the head) should take
place on lighter volume than the left shoulder. This is not a
requirement, but a strong tendency and an early warning of
diminishing buying pressure. The most important volume signal takes
place during the third peak (the right shoulder). Volume should be
noticeably lighter than on the previous two peaks. Volume should
then expand on the breaking of the neckline, decline during the return
move, and then expand again once the return move is over.
As mentioned earlier, volume is less critical during the completion of market tops. But, at some point, volume should begin to
increase if the new downtrend is to be continued. Volume plays a
much more decisive role at market bottoms, a subject to be discussed
shortly. Before doing so, however, let's discuss the measuring
implications of the head and shoulders pattern.

FINDING A PRICE OBJECTIVE
The method of arriving at a price objective is based on the height of
the pattern. Take the vertical distance from the head (point C) to the
neckline. Then project that distance from the point where the
neckline is broken. Assume, for example, that the top of the head is at
100 and the neckline is at 80. The vertical distance, therefore, would
be the difference, which is 20. That 20 points would be measured
downward from the level at which the neckline is broken. If the
neckline in Figure 5.1a is at 82 when broken, a downside objective
would be projected to the 62 level (82 - 20 = 62).
Another technique that accomplishes about the same task, but
is a bit easier, is to simply measure the length of the first wave of the
decline (points C to D) and then double it. In either case, the greater
the height or volatility of the pattern, the greater the objective.
Chapter 4 stated that the measurement taken from a trendline
penetration was similar to that used in the head and shoulders pattern.
You should be able to see that now. Prices travel roughly the same
distance below the broken neckline as they do above it. You'll see
throughout our entire study of price patterns that most price targets
on bar charts are based on the height or

www.Fxborssa.com

Major Reversal Patterns

109

volatility of the various patterns. The theme of measuring the height
of the pattern and then projecting that distance from a breakout point
will be constantly repeated.
It's important to remember that the objective arrived at is only
a minimum target. Prices will often move well beyond the objective.
Having a minimum target to work with, however, is very helpful in
determining beforehand whether there is enough potential in a market
move to warrant taking a position. If the market exceeds the price
objective, that's just icing on the cake. The maximum objective is the
size of the prior move. If the previous bull market went from 30 to
100, then the maximum downside objective from a topping pattern
would be a complete retracement of the entire upmove all the way
down to 30. Reversal patterns can only be expected to reverse or
retrace what has gone before them.
Adjusting Price Objectives
A number of other factors should be considered while trying to arrive
at a price objective. The measuring techniques from price patterns,
such as the one just mentioned for the head and shoulders top, are
only the first step. There are other technical factors to take into
consideration. For example, where are the prominent support levels
left by the reaction lows during the previous bull move? Bear markets
often pause at these levels. What about percentage retracements? The
maximum objective would be a 100% retracement of the previous bull
market. But where are the 50% and 66% retracement levels? Those
levels often provide significant support under the market. What about
any prominent gaps underneath? They often function as support
areas. Are there any long term trendlines visible below the market?
The technician must consider other technical data in trying to
pinpoint price targets taken from price patterns. If a downside price
measurement, for example, projects a target to 30, and there is a
prominent support level at 32, then the chartist would be wise to
adjust the downside measurement to 32 instead of 30. As a general
rule, when a slight discrepancy exists between a projected price target
and a clearcut support or resistance level, it's

usually safe to adjust the price target to that support or resistance
level. It is often necessary to adjust the measured targets from price
patterns to take into account additional technical information. The
analyst has many different tools at his or her disposal. The most
skillful technical analysts are those who learn to blend all of those
tools together properly.

THE INVERSE HEAD
AND SHOULDERS
The head and shoulders bottom, or the inverse head and shoulders as
it is sometimes called, is pretty much a mirror image of the topping
pattern. As Figure 5.2a shows, there are three distinct bot-

Figure 5.2a Example of an inverse head and shoulders. The bottom version of this pattern is a mirror image of the top. The only significant difference is the volume pattern in the second half of the pattern. The rally from
the head should see heavier volume, and the breaking of the neckline should
see a burst of trading activity. The return move back to the neckline is more
common at bottoms.

toms with the head (middle trough) a bit lower than either of the two
shoulders. A decisive close through the neckline is also necessary to
complete the pattern, and the measuring technique is the same. One
slight difference at the bottom is the greater tendency for the return
move back to the neckline to occur after the bullish breakout. (See
Figure 5.2b.)
The most important difference between the top and bottom
patterns is the volume sequence. Volume plays a much more critical
role in the identification and completion of a head and shoulders
bottom. This point is generally true of all bottom patterns. It was
stated earlier that markets have a tendency to "fall of their own
weight." At bottoms, however, markets require a significant increase
in buying pressure, reflected in greater volume, to launch a new bull
market.

(see arrow) nicked the neckline a bit, but then resumed the uptrend.

112

Chapter 5

A more technical way of looking at this difference is that a
market can fall just from inertia. Lack of demand or buying interest
on the part of traders is often enough to push a market lower; but a
market does not go up on inertia. Prices only rise when demand
exceeds supply and buyers are more aggressive than sellers.
The volume pattern at the bottom is very similar to that at the
top for the first half of the pattern. That is, the volume at the head is a
bit lighter than that at the left shoulder. The rally from the head,
however, should begin to show not only an increase in trading
activity, but the level of volume often exceeds that registered on the
rally from the left shoulder. The dip to the right shoulder should be
on very light volume. The critical point occurs at the rally through
the neckline. This signal must be accompanied by a sharp burst of
trading volume if the breakout is for real.
This point is where the bottom differs the most from the top.
At the bottom, heavy volume is an absolutely essential ingredient in
the completion of the basing pattern. The return move is more
common at bottoms than at tops and should occur on light volume.
Following that, the new uptrend should resume on heavier volume.
The measuring technique is the same as at the top.
The Slope of the Neckline
The neckline at the top usually slopes slightly upward. Sometimes,
however, it is horizontal. In either case, it doesn't make too much of a
difference. Once in a while, however, a top neckline slopes
downward. This slope is a sign of market weakness and is usually
accompanied by a weak right shoulder. However, this is a mixed
blessing. The analyst waiting for the breaking of the neckline to
initiate a short position has to wait a bit longer, because the signal
from the down sloping neckline occurs much later and only after
much of the move has already taken place. For basing patterns, most
necklines have a slight downward tilt. A rising neckline is a sign of
greater market strength, but with the same drawback of giving a later
signal.

COMPLEX HEAD AND
SHOULDERS PATTERNS
A variation of the head and shoulders pattern sometimes occurs
which is called the complex head and shoulders pattern. These are
patterns where two heads may appear or a double left and right
shoulder. These patterns are not that common, but have the same
forecasting implications. A helpful hint in this regard is the strong
tendency toward symmetry in the head and shoulders pattern. This
means that a single left shoulder usually indicates a single right
shoulder. A double left shoulder increases the odds of a double right
shoulder.
Tactics

Market tactics play an important role in all trading. Not all technical
traders like to wait for the breaking of the neckline before initiating a
new position. As Figure 5.3 shows, more aggressive traders,
believing that they have correctly identified a head and shoulders
bottom, will begin to probe the long side during the formation of the
right shoulder. Or they will buy the first technical signal that the
decline into the right shoulder has ended.
Some will measure the distance of the rally from the bottom
of the head (points C to D) and then buy a 50% or 66% retracement
of that rally. Still others would draw a tight down trendline along the
decline from points D to E and buy the first upside break of that
trendline. Because these patterns are reasonably symmetrical, some
will buy into the right shoulder as it approaches the same level as the
bottom of the left shoulder. A lot of anticipatory buying takes place
during the formation of the right shoulder. If the initial long probe
proves to be profitable, additional positions can be added on the
actual penetration of the neckline or on the return move back to the
neckline after the breakout.
The Failed Head And Shoulders Pattern
Once prices have moved through the neckline and completed a head
and shoulders pattern, prices should not recross the neckline

114

Chapter 5

Figure 5.3 Tactics for a head and shoulders bottom. Many technical
traders will begin to initiate long positions while the right shoulder (E) is
still being formed. One-half to two-thirds pullback of the rally from points
C to D, a decline to the same level as the left shoulder at point A, or the
breaking of a short term down trendline (line 1) all provide early opportunities for market entry. More positions can be added on the breaking of the
neckline or the return move back to the neckline.

again. At a top, once the neckline has been broken on the downside,
any decisive close back above the neckline is a serious warning that
the initial breakdown was probably a bad signal, and creates what is
often called, for obvious reasons, a failed head and shoulders. This
type of pattern starts out looking like a classic head and shoulders
reversal, but at some point in its development (either prior to the
breaking of the neckline or just after it), prices resume their original
trend.
There are two important lessons here. The first is that none of
these chart patterns are infallible. They work most of the time, but
not always. The second lesson is that technical traders must always
be on the alert for chart signs that their analysis is incorrect. One of
the keys to survival in the financial markets is to keep trading losses
small and to exit a losing trade as quickly as possible. One of the
greatest advantages of chart analysis is its ability

www.Fxborssa.com

Major Reversal Patterns

115

to quickly alert the trader to the fact that he or she is on the wrong
side of the market. The ability and willingness to quickly recognize
trading errors and to take defensive action immediately are qualities
not to be taken lightly in the financial markets.
The Head And Shoulders as a
Consolidation Pattern
Before moving on to the next price pattern, there's one final point to
be made on the head and shoulders. We started this discussion by
listing it as the best known and most reliable of the major reversal
patterns. You should be warned, however, that this formation can, on
occasion, act as a consolidation rather than a reversal pattern. When
this does happen, it's the exception rather than the rule. We'll talk
more about this in Chapter 6, "Continuation Patterns."

TRIPLE TOPS AND BOTTOMS
Most of the points covered in the treatment of the head and shoulders
pattern are also applicable to other types of reversal patterns. (See
Figures 5.4a-c.) The triple top or bottom, which is much rarer in
occurrence, is just a slight variation of that pattern. The main
difference is that the three peaks or troughs in the triple top or bottom
are at about the same level. (See Figure 5.4a.) Chartists often disagree
as to whether a reversal pattern is a head and shoulders or a triple top.
The argument is academic, because both patterns imply the exact
same thing.
The volume tends to decline with each successive peak at the
top and should increase at the breakdown point. The triple top is not
complete until support levels along both of the intervening lows have
been broken. Conversely, prices must close through the two
intervening peaks at the bottom to complete a triple bottom. (As an
alternate strategy, the breaking of the nearest peak or trough can also
be used as a reversal signal.) Heavy upside volume on the completion
of the bottom is also essential.

www.Fxborssa.com

Figure 5.4a A triple top. Similar to the head and shoulders except that all
peaks are at the same level. Each rally peak should be on lighter volume. The
pattern is complete when both troughs have been broken on heavier volume.
The measuring technique is the height of the pattern projected downward from
the breakdown point. Return moves back to the lower line are not unusual.

formation on this weekly chart lasted two full years, thereby giving it major
significance.

The measuring implication is also similar to the head and
shoulders, and is based on the height of the pattern. Prices will
usually move a minimum distance from the breakout point at least
equal to the height of the pattern. Once the breakout occurs, a return
move to the breakout point is not unusual. Because the triple top or
bottom represents only a minor variation of the head and shoulders
pattern, we won't say much more about it here.

DOUBLE TOPS AND BOTTOMS
A much more common reversal pattern is the double top or bottom.
Next to the head and shoulders, it is the most frequently seen and the
most easily recognized. (See Figures 5.5a-e.) Figures 5.5a and

In an uptrend (as shown in Figure 5.5a), the market sets a new
high at point A, usually on increased volume, and then declines to
point B on declining volume. So far, everything is proceeding as
expected in a normal uptrend. The next rally to point C, however, is
unable to penetrate the previous peak at A on a closing basis and
begins to fall back again. A potential double top has been set up. I use
the word "potential" because, as is the case with all reversal patterns,
the reversal is not complete until the

previous support point at B is violated on a closing basis. Until that
happens, prices could be in just a sideways consolidation phase,
preparing for a resumption of the original uptrend.
The ideal top has two prominent peaks at about the same
price level. Volume tends to be heavier during the first peak and
lighter on the second. A decisive close under the middle trough at
point B on heavier volume completes the pattern and signals a
reversal of trend to the downside. A return move to the breakout
point is not unusual prior to resumption of the downtrend.
Measuring Technique for the Double Top

height of the first downleg (points A to B) and project that length
downward from the middle trough at point B. Measurements at the
bottom are the same, but in the other direction.

VARIATIONS FROM THE
IDEAL PATTERN
As in most other areas of market analysis, real-life examples are
usually some variation of the ideal. For one thing, sometimes the two
peaks are not at exactly the same price level. On occasion, the second
peak will not quite reach the level of the first peak, which is not too
problematical. What does cause some problems is when

www.Fxborssa.com

722

Chapter 5

the second peak actually exceeds the first peak by a slight margin.
What at first may appear to be a valid upside breakout and
resumption of the uptrend may turn out to be part of the topping
process. To help resolve this dilemma, some of the filtering criteria
already mentioned may come in handy.
Filters
Most chartists require a close beyond a previous resistance peak
instead of just an intraday penetration. Second, a price filter of some
type might be used. One such example is a percentage penetration
criterion (such as 1% or 3%). Third, the two day penetration rule
could be used as an example of a time filter. In other words, prices
would have to close beyond the top of the first peak for two
consecutive days to signal a valid penetration. Another time filter
could be a Friday close beyond the previous peak. The volume on the
upside breakout might also provide a clue to its reliability.
These filters are certainly not infallible, but do serve to reduce
the number of false signals (or whipsaws) that often occur.
Sometimes these filters are helpful, and sometimes they're not. The
analyst must face the realization that he or she is dealing with
percentages and probabilities, and that there will be times when bad
signals occur. That's simply a fact of trading life.
It's not that unusual for the final leg or wave of a bull market
to set a new high before reversing direction. In such a case, the final
upside breakout would become a "bull trap." (See Figures 5.6a and
b.) We'll show you some indicators later on that may help you spot
these false breakouts.
The Term "Double Top" Greatly Overused
The terms "double top and bottom" are greatly overused in the
financial markets. Most potential double tops or bottoms wind up
being something else. The reason for this is that prices have a strong
tendency to back off from a previous peak or bounce off a previous
low. These price changes are a natural reaction and do not in
themselves constitute a reversal pattern. Remember that, at a top,
prices must actually violate the previous reaction low before the
double top exists.

Chapter 5

Notice in Figure 5.7a that the price at point C backs off from
the previous peak at point A. This is perfectly normal action in an
uptrend. Many traders, however, will immediately label this pattern
as a double top as soon as prices fail to clear the first peak on the first
attempt. Figure 5.7b shows the same situation in a downtrend. It is
very difficult for the chartist to determine whether the pullback from
the previous peak or the bounce from the previous low is just a
temporary setback in the existing trend or the start of a double top or
bottom reversal pattern. Because the technical odds usually favor
continuation of the present trend, it is usually wise to await
completion of the pattern before taking action.

pullback from a previous peak before
resumption of the uptrend. This is
normal market action and not to be
confused with a double top. The double top only occurs when support at

Time Between Peaks or Troughs Is
Important
Finally, the size of the pattern is always important. The longer the
time period between the two peaks and the greater the height of the
pattern, the greater the potential impending reversal. This is true of all
chart patterns. In general, most valid double tops or bottoms should
have at least a month between the two peaks or troughs. Some will
even be two or three months apart. (On longer range monthly and
weekly charts, these patterns can span several years.) Most of the
examples used in this discussion have described market tops. The
reader should be aware by now that bottoming patterns are mirror
images of tops except for some of the general differences already
touched upon at the beginning of the chapter.

SAUCERS AND SPIKES
Although not seen as frequently, reversal patterns sometimes take the
shape of saucers or rounding bottoms. The saucer bottom shows a
very slow and very gradual turn from down to sideways to up. It is
difficult to tell exactly when the saucer has been completed or to
measure how far prices will travel in the opposite direction. Saucer
bottoms are usually spotted on weekly or monthly charts that span
several years. The longer they last, the more significant they become.
(See Figure 5.8.)
Spikes are the hardest market turns to deal with because the
spike (or V pattern) happens very quickly with little or no transition
period. They usually take place in a market that has gotten so
overextended in one direction, that a sudden piece of adverse news
causes the market to reverse direction very abruptly. A daily or
weekly reversal, on very heavy volume, is sometimes the only
warning they give us. That being the case, there's not much more we
can say about them except that we hope you don't run into too many
of them. Some technical indicators we discuss in later chapters will
help you determine when markets have gotten dangerously overextended. (See Figure 5.9.)

Chapter 5

CONCLUSION
We've discussed the five most commonly used major reversal patterns—the head and shoulders, double and triple tops and bottoms, the saucer, and the V, or spike. Of those, the most common
are the head and shoulders, and double tops and bottoms. These
patterns usually signal important trend reversals in progress and
are classified as major reversal patterns. There is another class of
patterns, however, which are shorter term in nature and usually
suggest trend consolidations rather than reversals. They are aptly
called continuation patterns. Let's look at this other type of pattern
in Chapter 6.

www.Fxborssa.com

Continuation Patterns

INTRODUCTION
The chart patterns covered in this chapter are called continuation
patterns. These patterns usually indicate that the sideways price
action on the chart is nothing more than a pause in the prevailing
trend, and that the next move will be in the same direction as the
trend that preceded the formation. This distinguishes this group of
patterns from those in the previous chapter, which usually indicate
that a major trend reversal is in progress.
Another difference between reversal and continuation patterns
is their time duration. Reversal patterns usually take much longer to
build and represent major trend changes. Continuation patterns, on
the other hand, are usually shorter term in duration and are more
accurately classified as near term or intermediate patterns.
Notice the constant use of the term "usually." The treatment
of all chart patterns deals of necessity with general tendencies as
opposed to rigid rules. There are always exceptions. Even the
grouping of price patterns into different categories sometimes

129

www.Fxborssa.com

130

Chapter 6

becomes tenuous. Triangles are usually continuation patterns, but
sometimes act as reversal patterns. Although triangles are usually
considered intermediate patterns, they may occasionally appear on
long term charts and take on major trend significance. A variation of
the triangle—the inverted variety—usually signals a major market
top. Even the head and shoulders pattern, the best known of the major
reversal patterns, will on occasion be seen as a consolidation pattern.
Even with allowances for a certain amount of ambiguity and
the occasional exception, chart patterns do generally fall into the
above two categories and, if properly interpreted, can help the
chartist determine what the market will probably do most of the time

TRIANGLES
Let's begin our treatment of continuation patterns with the triangle.
There are three types of triangles—symmetrical, ascending, and
descending. (Some chartists include a fourth type of triangle known
as an expanding triangle, or broadening formation. This is treated as
a separate pattern later.) Each type of triangle has a slightly different
shape and has different forecasting implications.
Figures 6.1a-c show examples of what each triangle looks
like. The symmetrical triangle (see Figure 6.1a) shows two
converging trendlines, the upper line descending and the lower line
ascending. The vertical line at the left, measuring the height of the
pattern, is called the base. The point of intersection at the right,
where the two lines meet, is called the apex. For obvious reasons, the
symmetrical triangle is also called a coil.
The ascending triangle has a rising lower line with a flat or
horizontal upper line (see Figure 6.1b). The descending triangle
(Figure 6.1c), by contrast, has the upper line declining with a flat or
horizontal bottom line. Let's see how each one is interpreted.

132

Chapter 6

Figure 6.1c Example of a descending triangle. Notice the flat bottom line
and the declining upper line. This is usually a bearish pattern.

THE SYMMETRICAL TRIANGLE
The symmetrical triangle (or the coil) is usually a continuation
pattern. It represents a pause in the existing trend after which the
original trend is resumed. In the example in Figure 6.1a, the prior
trend was up, so that the percentages favor resolution of the
triangular consolidation on the upside. If the trend had been down,
then the symmetrical triangle would have bearish implications.
The minimum requirement for a triangle is four reversal
points. Remember that it always takes two points to draw a trendline.
Therefore, in order to draw two converging trendlines, each line must
be touched at least twice. In Figure 6.1a, the triangle actually begins
at point 1, which is where the consolidation in the uptrend begins.
Prices pull back to point 2 and then rally to point 3. Point 3, however,
is lower than point 1. The upper trendline can only be drawn once
prices have declined from point 3.
Notice that point 4 is higher than point 2. Only when prices
have rallied from point 4 can the lower upslanting line be drawn. It is
at this point that the analyst begins to suspect the he or she is dealing
with the symmetrical triangle. Now there are four reversal points (1,
2, 3, and 4) and two converging trendlines.
While the minimum requirement is four reversal points, many
triangles have six reversal points as shown in Figure 6.1a.

www.Fxborssa.com

Continuation Patterns

133

This means that there are actually three peaks and three troughs that
combine to form five waves within the triangle before the uptrend
resumes. (When we get to the Elliott Wave Theory, we'll have more
to say about the five wave tendency within triangles.)
Time Limit for Triangle Resolution
There is a time limit for the resolution of the pattern, and that is the
point where the two lines meet—at the apex. As a general rule, prices
should break out in the direction of the prior trend somewhere
between two-thirds to three-quarters of the horizontal width of the
triangle. That is, the distance from the vertical base on the left of the
pattern to the apex at the far right. Because the two lines must meet at
some point, that time distance can be measured once the two
converging lines are drawn. An upside breakout is signaled by a
penetration of the upper trendline. If prices remain within the triangle
beyond the three-quarters point, the triangle begins to lose its
potency, and usually means that prices will continue to drift out to the
apex and beyond
The triangle, therefore, provides an interesting combination of
price and time. The converging trendlines give the price boundaries
of the pattern, and indicate at what point the pattern has been
completed and the trend resumed by the penetration of the upper
trendline (in the case of an uptrend). But these trend-lines also
provide a time target by measuring the width of the pattern. If the
width, for example, were 20 weeks long, then the breakout should
take place sometime between the 13th and the 15th week. (See Figure
6.1d.)
The actual trend signal is given by a closing penetration of
one of the trendlines. Sometimes a return move will occur back to the
penetrated trendline after the breakout. In an uptrend, that line has
become a support line. In a downtrend, the lower line becomes a
resistance line once it's broken. The apex also acts as an important
support or resistance level after the breakout occurs. Various
penetration criteria can be applied to the breakout, similar to those
covered in the previous two chapters. A minimum penetration
criterion would be a closing price outside the trend-line and not just
an intraday penetration.

Figure 6. Id Dell formed a bullish symmetrical triangle during the fourth
quarter of 1997. Measured from left to right, the triangle width is 18 weeks.
Prices broke out on the 13th week (see circle), just beyond the two-thirds point.

Importance of Volume
Volume should diminish as the price swings narrow within the
triangle. This tendency for volume to contract is true of all consolidation patterns. But the volume should pick up noticeably at the
penetration of the trendline that completes the pattern. The return
move should be on light volume with heavier activity again as the
trend resumes.
Two other points should be mentioned about volume. As is
the case with reversal patterns, volume is more important on the
upside than on the downside. An increase in volume is essential to
the resumption of an uptrend in all consolidation patterns.
The second point about volume is that, even though trading
activity diminishes during formation of the pattern, a close inspection
of the volume usually gives a clue as to whether

www.Fxborssa.com

Continuation Patterns

the heavier volume is occurring during the upmoves or down-moves.
In an uptrend, for example, there should be a slight tendency for
volume to be heavier during the bounces and lighter on the price dips.
Measuring Technique
Triangles have measuring techniques. In the case of the symmetrical
triangle, there are a couple of techniques generally used. The simplest
technique is to measure the height of the vertical line at the widest
part of the triangle (the base) and measure that distance from the
breakout point. Figure 6.2 shows the distance projected from the
breakout point, which is the technique I prefer.
The second method is to draw a trendline from the top of the
base (at point A) parallel to the lower trendline. This upper channel
line then becomes the upside target in an uptrend. It is possible to
arrive at a rough time target for prices to meet the upper channel line.
Prices will sometimes hit the channel line at the same time the two
converging lines meet at the apex.
Figure 6.2 There
are two ways to take
a measurement from
a symmetrical triangle. One is to measure the height of the
base (AB); project
that vertical distance
from the breakout
point at C. Another
method is to draw a
parallel line upward
from the top of the
baseline (A) parallel
to the lower line in
the triangle.

THE ASCENDING TRIANGLE
The ascending and descending triangles are variations of the symmetrical, but have different forecasting implications. Figures 6.3a and
b show examples of an ascending triangle. Notice that the upper
trendline is flat, while the lower line is rising. This pattern indicates
that buyers are more aggressive than sellers. It is considered a bullish
pattern and is usually resolved with a breakout to the upside.
Both the ascending and descending triangles differ from the
symmetrical in a very important sense. No matter where in the trend
structure the ascending or descending triangles appear, they have
very definite forecasting implications. The ascending triangle is
bullish and the descending triangle is bearish. The symmetrical
triangle, by contrast, is inherently a neutral pattern. This does not
mean, however, that the symmetrical triangle does not have
forecasting value. On the contrary, because the symmetrical

Figure 6.3a An ascending triangle. The pattern is completed on a decisive
close above the upper line. This breakout should see a sharp increase in
volume. That upper resistance line should act as support on subsequent dips
after the breakout. The minimum price objective is obtained by measuring the
height of the triangle (AB) and projecting that distance upward from the
breakout point at C.

triangle is a continuation pattern, the analyst must simply look to see
the direction of the previous trend and then make the assumption that
the previous trend will continue.
Let's get back to the ascending triangle. As already stated,
more often than not, the ascending triangle is bullish. The bullish
breakout is signaled by a decisive closing above the flat upper
trendline. As in the case of all valid upside breakouts, volume should
see a noticeable increase on the breakout. A return move back to the
support line (the flat upper line) is not unusual and should take place
on light volume.
Measuring Technique
The measuring technique for the ascending triangle is relatively simple.
Simply measure the height of the pattern at its widest

138

Chapter 6

point and project that vertical distance from the breakout point. This
is just another example of using the volatility of a price pattern to
determine a minimum price objective.
The Ascending Triangle as a Bottom
While the ascending triangle most often appears in an uptrend and is
considered a continuation pattern, it sometimes appears as a
bottoming pattern. It is not unusual toward the end of a downtrend to
see an ascending triangle develop. However, even in this situation,
the interpretation of the pattern is bullish. The breaking of the upper
line signals completion of the base and is considered a bullish signal.
Both the ascending and descending triangles are sometimes also
referred to as right angle triangles.

THE DESCENDING TRIANGLE
The descending triangle is just a mirror image of the ascending, and
is generally considered a bearish pattern. Notice in Figures 6.4a and
b the descending upper line and the flat lower line. This pattern
indicates that sellers are more aggressive than buyers, and is usually
resolved on the downside. The downside signal is registered by a
decisive close under the lower trendline, usually on increased
volume. A return move sometimes occurs which should encounter
resistance at the lower trendline.
The measuring technique is exactly the same as the ascending
triangle in the sense that the analyst must measure the height of the
pattern at the base to the left and then project that distance down
from the breakdown point.
The Descending Triangle as a Top
While the descending triangle is a continuation pattern and usually is
found within downtrends, it is not unusual on occasion for the
descending triangle to be found at market tops. This type of pattern is
not that difficult to recognize when it does appear in the top setting.
In that case, a close below the flat lower line would signal a major
trend reversal to the downside.

Chapter 6

The Volume Pattern
The volume pattern in both the ascending and descending triangles is
very similar in that the volume diminishes as the pattern works itself
out and then increases on the breakout. As in the case of the
symmetrical triangle, during the formation the chartist can detect
subtle shifts in the volume pattern coinciding with the swings in the
price action. This means that in the ascending pattern, the volume
tends to be slightly heavier on bounces and lighter on dips. In the
descending formation, volume should be heavier on the downside
and lighter during the bounces.
The Time Factor in Triangles
One final factor to be considered on the subject of triangles is that of
the time dimension. The triangle is considered an intermediate
pattern, meaning that it usually takes longer than a month to form,
but generally less than three months. A triangle that lasts less than a
month is probably a different pattern, such as a pennant, which will
be covered shortly. As mentioned earlier, triangles sometimes appear
on long term price charts, but their basic meaning is always the same.

THE BROADENING FORMATION
This next price pattern is an unusual variation of the triangle and is
relatively rare. It is actually an inverted triangle or a triangle turned
backwards. All of the triangular patterns examined so far show
converging trendlines. The broadening formation, as the name
implies, is just the opposite. As the pattern in Figure 6.5 shows, the
trendlines actually diverge in the broadening formation, creating a
picture that looks like an expanding triangle. It is also called a
megaphone top.
The volume pattern also differs in this formation. In the other
triangular patterns, volume tends to diminish as the price swings
grow narrower. Just the opposite happens in the broadening
formation. The volume tends to expand along with the wider price
swings. This situation represents a market that is out of control

www.Fxborssa.com

Continuation Patterns

at major tops. It shows three successively higher peaks and two declining troughs.
The violation of the second trough completes the pattern. This is an unusually
difficult pattern to trade and fortunately is relatively rare.

and unusually emotional. Because this pattern also represents an
unusual amount of public participation, it most often occurs at major
market tops. The expanding pattern, therefore, is usually a bearish
formation. It generally appears near the end of a major bull market.

FLAGS AND PENNANTS
The flag and pennant formations are quite common. They are usually
treated together because they are very similar in appearance, tend to
show up at about the same place in an existing trend, and have the
same volume and measuring criteria.
The flag and pennant represent brief pauses in a dynamic market
move. In fact, one of the requirements for both the flag

www.Fxborssa.com

142

Chapter 6

and the pennant is that they be preceded by a sharp and almost
straight line move. They represent situations where a steep advance
or decline has gotten ahead of itself, and where the market pauses
briefly to "catch its breath" before running off again in the same
direction.
Flags and pennants are among the most reliable of continuation patterns and only rarely produce a trend reversal. Figures 6.6ab show what these two patterns look like. To begin with, notice the
steep price advance preceding the formations on heavy volume.
Notice also the dramatic drop off in activity as the consolidation
patterns form and then the sudden burst of activity on the upside
breakout.
Construction of Hags and Pennants
The construction of the two patterns differs slightly. The flag
resembles a parallelogram or rectangle marked by two parallel
trendlines that tend to slope against the prevailing trend. In a
downtrend, the flag would have a slight upward slope.

Figure 6.6a Example of
a bullish flag. The flag
usually occurs after a
sharp move and represents
a brief pause in the trend.
The flag should slope
against the trend. Volume
should dry up during the
formation and build again
on the breakout. The flag
usually occurs near the
midpoint of the move.

pennant. Resembles a small
symmetrical triangle, but
usually lasts no longer than
three weeks. Volume should be
light during its formation. The
move after the pennant is
completed should duplicate the
size of the move preceding it.

The pennant is
identified by two converging trendlines and is more horizontal. It
very closely resembles a small symmetrical triangle. An important
requirement is that volume should dry up noticeably while each of the
patterns is forming.
Both patterns are relatively short term and should be completed within one to three weeks. Pennants and flags in downtrends
tend to take even less time to develop, and often last no longer than
one or two weeks. Both patterns are completed on the penetration of
the upper trendline in an uptrend. The breaking of the lower trendline
would signal resumption of downtrends. The breaking of those
trendlines should take place on heavier volume. As usual, upside
volume is more critically important than downside volume. (See
Figures 6.7a-b.)
Measuring Implications
The measuring implications are similar for both patterns. Flags and
pennants are said to "fly at half-mast" from a flagpole. The flagpole is
the prior sharp advance or decline. The term "half-mast" suggests that
these minor continuation patterns tend to

appear at about the halfway point of the move. In general, the move
after the trend has resumed will duplicate the flagpole or the move
just prior to the formation of the pattern.
To be more precise, measure the distance of the preceding
move from the original breakout point. That is to say, the point at
which the original trend signal was given, either by the penetration of
a support or resistance level or an important trendline. That vertical
distance of the preceding move is then measured from the breakout
point of the flag or pennant—that is, the point at which the upper line
is broken in an uptrend or the lower line in a downtrend.
Summary
Let's summarize the more important points of both patterns.

Chapter 6

THE WEDGE FORMATION
The wedge formation is similar to a symmetrical triangle both in
terms of its shape and the amount of time it takes to form. Like the
symmetrical triangle, it is identified by two converging trend-lines
that come together at an apex. In terms of the amount of time it takes
to form, the wedge usually lasts more than one month but not more
than three months, putting it into the intermediate category.
What distinguishes the wedge is its noticeable slant. The
wedge pattern has a noticeable slant either to the upside or the
downside. As a rule, like the flag pattern, the wedge slants against the
prevailing trend. Therefore, a falling wedge is considered bullish and
a rising wedge is bearish. Notice in Figure 6.8a that the bullish
wedge slants downward between two converging trendlines. In the
downtrend in Figure 6.8b, the converging trendlines have an
unmistakable upward slant.

Figure 6.8a

falling wedge. The

two converging
trendlines, but

falling wedge is usually bullish.

Continuation Patterns

Wedges as Tops and Bottom
Reversal Patterns
Wedges show up most often within the existing trend and usually
constitute continuation patterns. The wedge can appear at tops or
bottoms and signal a trend reversal. But that type of situation is much
less common. Near the end of an uptrend, the chartist may observe a
clearcut rising wedge. Because a continuation wedge in an uptrend
should slope downward against the prevailing trend, the rising wedge
is a clue to the chartist that this is a bearish and not a bullish pattern.
At bottoms, a falling wedge would be a tip-off of a possible end of a
bear trend.
Whether the wedge appears in the middle or the end of a
market move, the market analyst should always be guided by the
general maxim that a rising wedge is bearish and a falling wedge is bullish.
(See Figure 6.8c.)

THE RECTANGLE FORMATION
The rectangle formation often goes by other names, but is usually
easy to spot on a price chart. It represents a pause in the trend during
which prices move sideways between two parallel horizontal lines.
(See Figures 6.9a-c.)
The rectangle is sometimes referred to as a trading range or a
congestion area. In Dow Theory parlance, it is referred to as a line.
Whatever it is called, it usually represents just a consolidation period
in the existing trend, and is usually resolved in the direc-

tion of the market trend that preceded its occurrence. In terms of
forecasting value, it can be viewed as being similar to the symmetrical triangle but with flat instead of converging trendlines.
A decisive close outside either the upper or lower boundary
signals completion of the rectangle and points the direction of the
trend. The market analyst must always be on the alert, however, that
the rectangular consolidation does not turn into a reversal pattern. In
the uptrend shown in Figure 6.9a, for example, notice that the three
peaks might initially be viewed as a possible triple top reversal
pattern.
The Importance of the Volume Pattern
One important clue to watch for is the volume pattern. Because the
price swings in both directions are fairly broad, the analyst should
keep a close eye on which moves have the heavier volume. If the
rallies are on heavier and the setbacks on lighter volume, then the
formation is probably a continuation in the uptrend. If the heavier
volume is on the downside, then it can be considered a warning of a
possible trend reversal in the works.
Swings Within the Range Can Be Traded
Some chartists trade the swings within such a pattern by buying dips
near the bottom and selling rallies near the top of the range. This
technique enables the short term trader to take advantage of the well
defined price boundaries, and profit from an otherwise trendless
market. Because the positions are being taken at the extremes of the
range, the risks are relatively small and well defined. If the trading
range remains intact, this countertrend trading approach works quite
well. When a breakout does occur, the trader not only exits the last
losing trade immediately, but can reverse the previous position by
initiating a new trade in the direction of the new trend. Oscillators are
especially useful in sideways trading markets, but less useful once
the breakout has occurred for reasons discussed in Chapter 10.
Other traders assume the rectangle is a continuation pattern
and take long positions near the lower end of the price band

www.Fxborssa.com

Continuation Patterns

151

in an uptrend, or initiate short positions near the top of the range in
downtrends. Others avoid such trendless markets altogether and await
a clearcut breakout before committing their funds. Most trendfollowing systems perform very poorly during these periods of
sideways and trendless market action.
Other Similarities and Differences
In terms of duration, the rectangle usually falls into the one to three
month category, similar to triangles and wedges. The volume pattern
differs from other continuation patterns in the sense that the broad
price swings prevent the usual dropoff in activity seen in other such
patterns.
The most common measuring technique applied to the
rectangle is based on the height of the price range. Measure the height
of the trading range, from top to bottom, and then project that vertical
distance from the breakout point. This method is similar to the other
vertical measuring techniques already mentioned, and is based on the
volatility of the market. When we cover the count in point and figure
charting, we'll say more on the question of horizontal price
measurements.
Everything mentioned so far concerning volume on breakouts
and the probability of return moves applies here as well. Because the
upper and lower boundaries are horizontal and so well defined in the
rectangle, support and resistance levels are more clearly evident. This
means that, on upside breakouts, the top of the former price band
should now provide solid support on any selloffs. After a downside
breakout in downtrends, the bottom of the trading range (the previous
support area) should now provide a solid ceiling over the market on
any rally attempts.

THE MEASURED MOVE
The measured move, or the swing measurement as it is sometimes
called, describes the phenomenon where a major market advance or
decline is divided into two equal and parallel moves, as shown in
Figure 6.10a. For this approach to work, the market moves

www.Fxborssa.com

Figure 6.10a

move (or the swing measurement) in an uptrend.
This theory holds that the
second leg in the advance
(CD) duplicates the size
and slope of the first
upleg (AB). The corrective
wave (BC) often retraces a
third to a half of AB
before the uptrend is
resumed.

Figure 6.10b A measured move takes the prior upleg (AB) and adds that
value to the bottom of the correction at C. On this chart, the prior uptrend

target to 82 (D).

Continuation Patterns

should be fairly orderly and well defined. The measured move is
really just a variation of some of the techniques we've already
touched on. We've seen that some of the consolidation patterns, such
as flags and pennants, usually occur at about the halfway point of a
market move. We've also mentioned the tendency of markets to
retrace about a third to a half of a prior trend before resuming that
trend.
In the measured move, when the chartist sees a well-defined
situation, such as in Figure 6.10a, with a rally from point A to point B
followed by a countertrend swing from point B to point C (which
retraces a third to a half of wave AB), it is assumed that the next leg
in the uptrend (CD) will come close to duplicating the first leg (AB).
The height of wave (AB), therefore, is simply measured upward from
the bottom of the correction at point C.

THE CONTINUATION HEAD AND
SHOULDERS PATTERN
In the previous chapter, we treated the head and shoulders pattern at
some length and described it as the best known and most trustworthy
of all reversal patterns. The head and shoulders pattern can
sometimes appear as a continuation instead of a reversal pattern.
In the continuation head and shoulders variety, prices trace
out a pattern that looks very similar to a sideways rectangular pattern
except that the middle trough in an uptrend (see Figure 6.11a) tends
to be lower than either of the two shoulders. In a downtrend (see
Figure 6.11b), the middle peak in the consolidation exceeds the other
two peaks. The result in both cases is a head and shoulders pattern
turned upside down. Because it is turned upside down, there is no
chance of confusing it with the reversal pattern.

CONFIRMATION AND
DIVERGENCE
The principle of confirmation is one of the common themes running
throughout the entire subject of market analysis, and is used in
conjunction with its counterpart—divergence. We'll introduce both
concepts here and explain their meaning, but we'll return to them
again and again throughout the book because their impact is so
important. We're discussing confirmation here in the context of chart
patterns, but it applies to virtually every aspect of technical analysis.
Confirmation refers to the comparison of all technical signals and
indicators to ensure that most of those indicators are pointing in the
same direction and are confirming one another.

www.Fxborssa.com

156

Chapter 6

Divergence is the opposite of confirmation and refers to a
situation where different technical indicators fail to confirm one
another. While it is being used here in a negative sense, divergence is a valuable concept in market analysis, and one of the best
early warning signals of impending trend reversals. We'll discuss
the principle of divergence at greater length in Chapter 10,
"Oscillators and Contrary Opinion."

CONCLUSION
This concludes our treatment of price patterns. We stated earlier
that the three pieces of raw data used by the technical analyst
were price, volume, and open interest. Most of what we've said so far
has focused on price. Let's take a closer look now at volume and
open interest and how they are incorporated into the analytical
process.

www.Fxborssa.com

Volume and Open
Interest

INTRODUCTION
Most technicians in the financial markets use a multidimensional approach to market analysis by tracking the movement of three
sets of figures—price, volume, and open interest. Volume analysis
applies to all markets. Open interest applies primarily to futures
markets. Chapter 3 discussed the construction of the daily bar
chart and showed how the three figures were plotted on that type
of chart. It was stated then that even though volume and open
interest figures are available for each delivery month in futures
markets, the total figures are the ones generally used for forecasting purposes. Stock chartists simply plot total volume along with
the accompanying price.
Most of the discussion of charting theory to this point has
concentrated mainly on price action with some mention of volume. In this chapter, we'll round out the three dimensional
approach by taking a closer look at the role played by volume and
open interest in the forecasting process.

VOLUME AND OPEN INTEREST AS
SECONDARY INDICATORS
Let's begin by placing volume and open interest in their proper
perspective. Price is by far the most important. Volume and open
interest are secondary in importance and are used primarily as confirming indicators. Of those two, volume is the more important.
Volume
Volume is the number of entities traded during the time period under
study. Because we'll be dealing primarily with daily bar charts, our
main concern is with daily volume. That daily volume is plotted by a
vertical bar at the bottom of the chart under the day's price action.
(See Figure 7.1.)

Volume can be plotted for weekly bar charts as well. In that
case, total volume for the week would simply be plotted under the bar
representing that week's price action. Volume is usually not used,
however, on monthly bar charts.
Open Interest in Futures
The total number of outstanding or unliquidated contracts at the end
of the day is open interest. In Figure 7.2, open interest is the solid line
plotted on the chart under its corresponding price data for the day, but
above the volume bars. Remember that official volume and open
interest figures are reported a day late in the futures markets and are,
therefore, plotted with a one day lag. (Only estimated volume figures
are available for the last trading day.) That means that each day the
chartist plots the high, low, and closing price bar for the last day of
trading, but plots the official volume and open interest figures for the
previous day.
Open interest represents the total number of outstanding longs
or shorts in the market, not the sum of both. Open interest is the
number of contracts. A contract must have both a buyer and a seller.
Therefore, two market participants—a buyer and a seller— combine
to create only one contract. The open interest figure reported each
day is followed by either a positive or negative number showing the
increase or decrease in the number of contracts for that day. It is
those changes in the open interest levels, either up or down, that give
the chartist clues as to the changing character of market participation
and give open interest its forecasting value.
How Changes in Open Interest Occur. In order to grasp the significance of how changes in the open interest numbers are interpreted,
the reader must first understand how each trade produces a change in
those numbers.
Every time a trade is completed on the floor of the exchange,
the open interest is affected in one of three ways—it increases,
decreases, or stays unchanged. Let's see how those changes occur.

3. Buys old short

In the first case, both the buyer and seller are initiating a new
position and a new contract is established. In case 2, the buyer is
initiating a new long position, but the seller is merely liquidating an
old long. One is entering and the other exiting a trade. The result is a
standoff and no change takes place in the number of contracts. In
case 3, the same thing happens except this time it is the seller who is
initiating a new short and the buyer who is only covering an old
short. Because one of the traders is entering and the other exiting a
trade, again no change is produced. In case 4, both traders are
liquidating an old position and the open interest decreases
accordingly.
To sum up, if both participants in a trade are initiating a new
position, the open interest will increase. If both are liquidating an old
position, the open interest will decline. If, however, one is initiating a
new trade while the other is liquidating an old trade, open interest
will remain unchanged. By looking at the net change in the total open
interest at the end of the day, the chartist is able to determine whether
money is flowing into or out of the market. This information enables
the analyst to draw some conclusions about the strength or weakness
of the current price trend.
General Rules for Interpreting Volume and Open
Interest
The futures technician incorporates volume and open interest
information into market analysis. The rules for the interpretation of
volume and open interest are generally combined because they are so
similar. There are, however, some distinctions between the two that
should be addressed. We'll begin here with a statement of the general
rules for both. Having done that, we'll then treat each one separately
before combining them again at the end.

If volume and open interest are both increasing, then the
current price trend will probably continue in its present direction
(either up or down). If, however, volume and open interest are
declining, the action can be viewed as a warning that the current price
trend may be nearing an end. Having said that, let's now take a look
at volume and open interest separately. (See Figure 7.2.)

Chapter 7

INTERPRETATION OF VOLUME
FOR ALL MARKETS
The level of volume measures the intensity or urgency behind the
price move. Heavier volume reflects a higher degree of intensity or
pressure. By monitoring the level of volume along with price action,
the technician is better able to gauge the buying or selling pressure
behind market moves. This information can then be used to confirm
price movement or warn that a price move is not to be trusted. (See
Figures 7.3 and 7.4.)
To state the rule more concisely, volume should increase or
expand in the direction of the existing price trend. In an uptrend, volume
should be heavier as the price moves higher, and should decrease or
contract on price dips. As long as this pattern continues, volume is
said to be confirming the price trend.

Figure 7.4 The volume bars are following Intel's price uptrend. Volume is
heavier as prices are rising, and drops off as prices weaken. Notice the burst of
trading activity during the last three days' price jump.

The chartist is also watching for signs of divergence (there's
that word again). Divergence occurs if the penetration of a previous
high by the price trend takes place on declining volume. This action
alerts the chartist to diminishing buying pressure. If the volume also
shows a tendency to pick up on price dips, the analyst begins to
worry that the uptrend is in trouble.
Volume as Confirmation in Price Patterns
During our treatment of price patterns in Chapters 5 and 6, volume
was mentioned several times as an important confirming indicator.
One of the first signs of a head and shoulders top occurred when
prices moved into new highs during the formation of the head on
light volume with heavier activity on the subsequent decline to the
neckline. The double and triple tops saw lighter volume on each successive peak followed by heavier downside activity. Continuation

Chapter 7

patterns, like the triangle, should be accompanied by a gradual drop
off in volume. As a rule, the resolution of all price patterns (the
breakout point) should be accompanied by heavier trading activity if
the signal given by that breakout is real. (See Figure 7.5.)
In a downtrend, the volume should be heavier during down
moves and lighter on bounces. As long as that pattern continues, the
selling pressure is greater than buying pressure and the downtrend
should continue. It's only when that pattern begins to change that the
chartist starts looking for signs of a bottom.
Volume Precedes Price
By monitoring the price and volume together, we're actually using
two different tools to measure the same thing—pressure. By

Figure 7.5 The first half of this chart shows a positive trend with heavier
volume on up days. The box at the top shows a sudden downturn on heavy
volume—a negative sign. Notice the increase in trading as the continuation
triangle is broken on the downside.

Volume and Open Interest

165

the mere fact that prices are trending higher, we can see that there is
more buying than selling pressure. It stands to reason then that the
greater volume should take place in the same direction as the
prevailing trend. Technicians believe that volume precedes price,
meaning that the loss of upside pressure in an uptrend or downside
pressure in a downtrend actually shows up in the volume figures
before it is manifested in a reversal of the price trend.
On Balance Volume
Technicians have experimented with many volume indicators to help
quantify buying or selling pressure. Trying to "eyeball" the vertical
volume bars along the bottom of the chart is not always precise
enough to detect significant shifts in the volume flow. The simplest
and best known of these volume indicators is on balance volume or
OBV. Developed and popularized by Joseph Granville in his 1963
book, Granville's New Key to Stock Market Profits, OBV actually
produces a curving line on the price chart. This line can be used either
to confirm the quality of the current price trend or warn of an
impending reversal by diverging from the price action.
Figure 7.6 shows the price chart with the OBV line along the
bottom of the chart instead of the volume bars. Notice how much
easier it is to follow the volume trend with the OBV line.
The construction of the OBV line is simplicity itself. The total
volume for each day is assigned a plus or minus value depending on
whether prices close higher or lower for that day. A higher close
causes the volume for that day to be given a plus value, while a lower
close counts for negative volume. A running cumulative total is then
maintained by adding or subtracting each day's volume based on the
direction of the market close.
It is the direction of the OBV line (its trend) that is important
and not the actual numbers themselves. The actual OBV values will
differ depending on how far back you are charting. Let the computer
handle the calculations. Concentrate on the direction of the OBV line.
The on balance volume line should follow in the same direction as the price trend. If prices show a series of higher peaks and

Chapter 7

in October 1997.
troughs (an uptrend), the OBV line should do the same. If prices are
trending lower, so should the OBV line. It's when the volume line
fails to move in the same direction as prices that a divergence exists
and warns of a possible trend reversal.
Alternatives to OBV
The on balance volume line does its job reasonably well, but it has
some shortcomings. For one thing, it assigns an entire day's volume a
plus or minus value. Suppose a market closes up on the day by some
minimal amount such as one or two tics. Is it reasonable to assign all
of that day's activity a positive value? Or consider a situation where
the market spends most of the day on the upside, but then closes
slightly lower. Should all of that day's volume be

www.Fxborssa.com

Volume and Open Interest

167

given a negative value? To resolve these questions, technicians have
experimented with many variations of OBV in an attempt to discover
the true upside and downside volume.
One variation is to give greater weight to those days where
the trend is the strongest. On an up day, for example, the volume is
multiplied by the amount of the price gain. This technique still
assigns positive and negative values, but gives greater weight to those
days with greater price movement and reduces the impact of those
days where the actual price change is minimal.
There are more sophisticated formulas that blend volume (and
open interest) with price action. James Sibbet's Demand Index, for
example, combines price and volume into a leading market indicator.
The Herrick Payoff Index uses open interest to measure money flow.
(See Appendix A for an explanation of both indicators.)
It should be noted that volume reporting in the stock market is
much more useful than in the futures markets. Stock trading volume
is reported immediately, while it is reported a day late for futures.
Levels of upside and downside volume are also available for stocks,
but not in futures. The availability of volume data for stocks on each
price change during the day has facilitated an even more advanced
indicator called Money Flow, developed by Laszlo Birinyi, Jr. This
real-time version of OBV tracks the level of volume on each price
change in order to determine if money is flowing into or out of a
stock. This sophisticated calculation, however, requires a lot of
computer power and isn't readily available to most traders.
These more sophisticated variations of OBV have basically
the same intent—to determine whether the heavier volume is taking
place on the upside (bullish) or the downside (bearish). Even with its
simplicity, the OBV line still does a pretty good job of tracking the
volume flow in a market—either in futures or stocks. And OBV is
readily available on most charting software. Most charting packages
even allow you to plot the OBV line right over the price data for even
easier comparison. (See Figures 7.7 and 7.8.)

Other Volume Limitations in Futures
We've already mentioned the problem of the one day lag in reporting
futures volume. There is also the relatively awkward practice of
using total volume numbers to analyze individual contracts instead of
each contract's actual volume. There are good reasons for using total
volume. But how does one deal with situations when some contracts
close higher and others lower in the same futures market on the same
day? Limit days produce other problems. Days when markets are
locked limit up usually produce very light volume. This is a sign of
strength as the numbers of buyers so overwhelm the sellers that
prices reach the maximum trading limit and cease trading. According
to the traditional rules of interpretation, light volume on a rally is
bearish. The light volume on limit days is a violation of that principle
and can distort OBV numbers.

Figure 7.8 Overlaying the OBV (solid line) right over the price bars
makes for easier comparison between price and volume. This chart of
McDonalds shows the OBV line leading the price higher and warning in
advance of the bullish breakout.
Even with these limitations, however, volume analysis can
still be used in the futures markets, and the technical trader would be
well advised to keep a watchful eye on volume indications.

INTERPRETATION OF OPEN
INTEREST IN FUTURES
The rules for interpreting open interest changes are similar to those for
volume, but require additional explanation.
1. With prices advancing in an uptrend and total open interest
increasing, new money is flowing into the market reflecting
aggressive new buying, and is considered bullish. (See Figure
7.9.)

www.Fxborssa.com

170

Chapter 7

Figure 7.9 The uptrend in silver prices was confirmed by a similar rise in
the open interest line. The boxes to the right show some normal liquidation of
outstanding contracts as prices start to correct downward.
2. If, however, prices are rising and open interest declines, the
rally is being caused primarily by short covering (holders of losing short positions being forced to cover those positions).
Money is leaving rather than entering the market. This action is
considered bearish because the uptrend will probably run out
of steam once the necessary short covering has been
completed. (See Figure 7.10.)
3. With prices in a downtrend and open interest rising, the
technician knows that new money is flowing into the market,
reflecting aggressive new short selling. This action increases
the odds that the downtrend will continue and is considered
bearish. (See Figure 7.11.)
4. If, however, total open interest is declining along with
declining prices, the price decline is being caused by discour-

with price, not against it.

aged or losing longs being forced to liquidate their positions. This
action is believed to indicate a strengthening technical
situation because the downtrend will probably end once open
interest has declined sufficiently to show that most losing
longs have completed their selling.
Let's summarize these four points:
1. Rising open interest in an uptrend is bullish.
2. Declining open interest in an uptrend is bearish.
3. Rising open interest in a downtrend is bearish.
4. Declining open interest in a downtrend is bullish.

www.Fxborssa.com

172

Chapter 7

Figure 7.11 The downturn in copper during the summer of 1997 and the
subsequent price decline was accompanied by rising open interest. Rising open
interest during a price decline is bearish because it reflects aggressive short
selling.
Other Situations Where Open Interest Is
Important
In addition to the preceding tendencies, there are other market
situations where a study of open interest can prove useful.
1. Toward the end of major market moves, where open
interest has been increasing throughout the price trend, a leveling off
or decline in open interest is often an early warning of a change in
trend.
2. A high open interest figure at market tops can be considered
bearish if the price drop is very sudden. This means that all of the
new longs established near the end of the uptrend now have losing
positions. Their forced liquidation will keep prices under pressure
until the open interest has declined sufficiently. As an exam-

www.Fxborssa.com

Volume and Open Interest

173

pie, let's assume that an uptrend has been in effect for some time.
Over the past month, open interest has increased noticeably.
Remember that every new open interest contract has one new long
and one new short. Suddenly, prices begin to drop sharply and fall
below the lowest price set over the past month. Every single new long
established during that month now has a loss.
The forced liquidation of those longs keeps prices under
pressure until they have all been liquidated. Worse still, their forced
selling often begins to feed on itself and, as prices are pushed even
lower, causes additional margin selling by other longs and intensifies
the new price decline. As a corollary to the preceding point, an
unusually high open interest in a bull market is a danger signal.
3. If open interest builds up noticeably during a sideways consolidation or a horizontal trading range, the ensuing price move intensifies once the breakout occurs. This only stands to reason. The market is in a period of indecision. No one is sure which direction the
trend breakout will take. The increase in open interest, however, tells
us that a lot of traders are taking positions in anticipation of the
breakout. Once that breakout does occur, a lot of traders are going to
be caught on the wrong side of the market.
Let's assume we've had a three month trading range and that
the open interest has jumped by 10,000 contracts. This means that
10,000 new long positions and 10,000 new short positions have been
taken. Prices then break out on the upside and new three month highs
are established. Because prices are trading at the highest point in
three months, every single short position (all 10,000 of them)
initiated during the previous three months now shows a loss. The
scramble to cover those losing shorts naturally causes additional
upside pressure on prices, producing even more panic. Prices remain
strong until all or most of those 10,000 short positions have been
offset by buying into the market strength. If the breakout had been to
the downside, then it would have been the longs doing the
scrambling.
The early stage of any new trend immediately following a
breakout is usually fueled by forced liquidation by those caught on
the wrong side of the market. The more traders caught on the wrong
side (manifested in the high open interest), the more severe the
response to a sudden adverse market move. On a more

www.Fxborssa.com

174

Chapter 7

positive note, the new trend is further aided by those on the right side
of the market whose judgment has been vindicated, and who are now
using accumulated paper profits to finance additional positions. It can
be seen why the greater the increase in open interest during a trading
range (or any price formation for that matter), the greater the
potential for the subsequent price move.
4. Increasing open interest at the completion of a price pattern
is viewed as added confirmation of a reliable trend signal. The breaking
of the neckline, for example, of a head and shoulders bottom is more
convincing if the breakout occurs on increasing open interest along
with the heavier volume. The analyst has to be careful here. Because
the impetus following the initial trend signal is often caused by those
on the wrong side of the market, sometimes the open interest dips
slightly at the beginning of a new trend. This initial dip in the open
interest can mislead the unwary chart reader, and argues against
focusing too much attention on the open interest changes over the
very short term.

SUMMARY OF VOLUME AND OPEN
INTEREST RULES
Let's summarize some of the more important elements of price,
volume, and open interest.
1. Volume is used in all markets; open interest mainly in
futures.
2. Only the total volume and open interest are used for futures.
3. Increasing volume (and open interest) indicate that the
current price trend will probably continue.
4. Declining volume (and open interest) suggest that the price
trend may be changing.
5. Volume precedes price. Changes in buying or selling pressure are often detected in volume before price.
6. On balance volume (OBV), or some variation thereof, can be
used to more accurately measure the direction of volume
pressure.

www.Fxborssa.com

Volume and Open Interest

175

7. Within an uptrend, a sudden leveling off or decline in open
interest often warns of a change in trend. (This applies only
to futures.)
8. Very high open interest at market tops is dangerous and can
intensify downside pressure. (This applies only to futures.)
9. A buildup in open interest during consolidation periods
intensifies the ensuing breakout. (This applies only to
futures.)
10. Increases in volume (and open interest) help confirm the
resolution of price patterns or any other significant chart
developments that signal the beginning of a new trend.

BLOWOFFS AND
SELLING CLIMAXES
One final situation not covered so far that deserves mention is the
type of dramatic market action that often takes place at tops and
bottoms—blowoffs and selling climaxes. Blowoffs occur at major
market tops and selling climaxes at bottoms. In futures, blowoffs are
often accompanied by a drop in open interest during the final rally. In
the case of a blowoff at market tops, prices suddenly begin to rally
sharply after a long advance, accompanied by a large jump in trading
activity and then peak abruptly. (See Figure 7.12.) In a selling climax
bottom, prices suddenly drop sharply on heavy trading activity and
rebound as quickly. (Refer back to Figure 4.22c.)

COMMITMENTS OF
TRADERS REPORT
Our treatment of open interest would not be complete without
mentioning the Commitments of Traders (COT) Report, and how it is
used by futures technicians as a forecasting tool. The report is
released by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)
twice a month—a mid-month report and one at month's end. The

report breaks down the open interest numbers into three categories—
large hedgers, large speculators, and small traders. The large hedgers,
also called commercials, use the futures markets primarily for
hedging purposes. Large speculators include the large commodity
funds, who rely primarily on mechanical trend-following systems.
The final category of small traders includes the general public, who
trade in much smaller amounts.

WATCH THE COMMERCIALS
The guiding principle in analyzing the Commitments Report is the
belief that the large commercial hedgers are usually right, while the
traders are usually wrong. That being the case, the idea is to place
yourself in the same positions as the hedgers and in the opposite
positions of the two categories of traders. For example, a

www.Fxborssa.com

Volume and Open Interest

177

bullish signal at a market bottom would occur when the commercials
are heavily net long while the large and small traders are heavily net
short. In a rising market, a warning signal of a possible top would
take place when the large and small traders become heavily net long
at the same time that the commercials are becoming heavily net short.

NET TRADER POSITIONS
It is possible to chart the trends of the three market groups, and to use
those trends to spot extremes in their positions. One way to do that is
to study the net trader positions published in Futures Charts
(Published by Commodity Trend Service, PO Box 32309, Palm
Beach Gardens, FL 33420). That charting service plots three lines
that show the net trader positions for all three groups on a weekly
price chart for each market going back four years. By providing four
years of data, historical comparisons are easily done. Nick Van Nice,
the publisher of that chart service, looks for situations where the
commercials are at one extreme, and the two categories of traders at
the other, to find buying and selling opportunities (as shown in
Figures 7.13 and 7.14). Even if you don't use the COT Report as a
primary input in your trading decisions, it's not a bad idea to keep an
eye on what those three groups are doing.

OPEN INTEREST IN OPTIONS
Our coverage of open interest has concentrated on the futures
markets. Open interest plays an important role in options trading as
well. Open interest figures are published each day for put and call
options on futures markets, stock averages, industry indexes, and
individual stocks. While open interest in options may not be
interpreted in exactly the same way as in futures, it tells us essentially
the same thing—where the interest is and the liquidity. Some option
traders compare call open interest (bulls) to put open interest (bears)
in order to measure market sentiment. Others use option volume.

to determine the degree of bullishness or bearishness in a market.
One of the primary uses of volume data in options trading is the
construction of put/call volume ratios. When options traders are
bullish, call volume exceeds put volume and the put/call ratio falls. A
bearish attitude is reflected in heavier put volume and a higher
put/call ratio. The put/call ratio is usually viewed as a contrary
indicator. A very high ratio signals an oversold market. A very low
ratio is a negative warning of an overbought market.

COMBINE OPTION SENTIMENT
WITH TECHNICALS
Options traders use open interest and volume put/call figures to
determine extremes in bullish or bearish sentiment. These sentiment
readings work best when combined with technical measures such as
support, resistance, and the trend of the underlying market. Since
timing is so crucial in options, most option traders are technically
oriented.

CONCLUSION
That concludes our coverage of volume and open interest, at least for
now. Volume analysis is used in all financial markets—futures,

options, and stocks. Open interest applies only to futures and
options. But, since futures and options are traded on so many
stock market vehicles, some understanding of how open interest
works can be useful in all three financial arenas. In most of our
discussions so far, we've concentrated on daily bar charts. The
next step is to broaden our time horizon and to learn how to
apply the tools we've learned to weekly and monthly charts in
order to perform long range trend analysis. We'll accomplish that
in the next chapter.

Long Term Charts

INTRODUCTION
Of all the charts utilized by the market technician for forecasting
and trading the financial markets, the daily bar chart is by far the
most popular. The daily bar chart usually covers a period of only six
to nine months. However, because most traders confine their interest to relatively short term market action, daily bar charts have
gained wide acceptance as the primary working tool of the chartist.
The average trader's dependence on these daily charts,
however, and the preoccupation with short term market behavior,
cause many to overlook a very useful and rewarding area of price
charting—the use of weekly and monthly charts for longer range trend
analysis and forecasting.
The daily bar chart covers a relatively short period of time
in the life of any market. A thorough trend analysis of a market,
however, should include some consideration of how the daily
market price is moving in relation to its long range trend structure. To accomplish that task, longer range charts must be employed.
Whereas on the daily bar chart each bar represents one day's price

787

www.Fxborssa.com

182

Chapter 8

action, on the weekly and monthly charts each price bar represents
one week's and one month's price action, respectively. The purpose of
weekly and monthly charts is to compress price action in such a way
that the time horizon can be greatly expanded and much longer time
periods can be studied.

THE IMPORTANCE OF LONGER
RANGE PERSPECTIVE
Long range price charts provide a perspective on the market trend that
is impossible to achieve with the use of daily charts alone. During our
introduction to the technical philosophy in Chapter 1, it was pointed
out that one of the greatest advantages of chart analysis is the
application of its principles to virtually any time dimension,
including long range forecasting. We also addressed the fallacy,
espoused by some, that technical analysis should be limited to short
term "timing" with longer range forecasting left to the fundamental
analyst.
The accompanying charts will demonstrate that the principles
of technical analysis—including trend analysis, support and
resistance levels, trendlines, percentage retracements, and price
patterns—lend themselves quite well to the analysis of long range
price movements. Anyone who is not consulting these longer range
charts is missing an enormous amount of valuable price information.

CONSTRUCTION OF
CONTINUATION CHARTS
FOR FUTURES
The average futures contract has a trading life of about a year and a
half before expiration. This limited life feature poses some obvious
problems for the technician interested in constructing a long range
chart going back several years. Stock market technicians don't have
this problem. Charts are readily available for individual common
stocks and the market averages from the inception of trading. How
then does the futures technician construct longer range charts for
contracts that are constantly expiring?

www.Fxborssa.com

Long Term Charts

183

The answer is the continuation chart. Notice the emphasis on
the word "continuation." The technique most commonly employed is
simply to link a number of contracts together to provide continuity.
When one contract expires, another one is used. In order to
accomplish this, the simplest method, and the one used by most chart
services, is to always use the price of the nearest expiring contract.
When that nearest expiring contract stops trading, the next in line
becomes the nearest contract and is the one plotted.
Other Ways to Construct
Continuation Charts
The technique of linking prices of the nearest expiring contracts is
relatively simple and does solve the problem of providing price
continuity. However, there are some problems with that method.
Sometimes the expiring contract may be trading at a significant
premium or discount to the next contract, and the changeover to the
new contract may cause a sudden price drop or jump on the chart.
Another potential distortion is the extreme volatility experienced by
some spot contracts just before expiration.
Futures technicians have devised many ways to deal with
these occasional distortions. Some will stop plotting the nearest
contract a month or two before it expires to avoid the volatility in the
spot month. Others will avoid using the nearest contract altogether
and will instead chart the second or third contract. Another method is
to chart the contract with the highest open interest on the theory that
that delivery month is the truest representation of market value.
Continuation charts can also be constructed by linking
specific calendar months. For example, a November soybean
continuation chart would combine only the historic data provided by
each successive year's November soybean contract. (This technique
of linking specific delivery months was favored by W.D. Gann.)
Some chartists go even further by averaging the prices of several
contracts, or constructing indices that attempt to smooth the
changeover by making adjustments in the price premium or discount.

184

Chapter 8

THE PERPETUAL CONTRACT™
An innovative solution to the problem of price continuity was
developed by Robert Pelletier, president of Commodity Systems,
Inc., a commodity and stock data service (CSI. 200 W. Palmetto
Park Road, Boca Raton, FL 33422), called the Perpetual Contract.™
("Perpetual Contract™ " is a registered trademark of that firm.)
The purpose of the Perpetual Contract™ is to provide years
of futures price history in one continuous time series. That is
accomplished by constructing a time series based on a constant
forward time period. For example, the series would determine a
value three months or six months into the future. The time period varies and can be chosen by the user. The Perpetual Contract™
is constructed by taking a weighted average of two futures contracts that surround the time period desired.
The value for the Perpetual Contract™ is not an actual
price, but a weighted average of two other prices. The main advantage of the Perpetual Contract™ is that it eliminates the need for
using only the nearest expiring contract and smoothes out the
price series by eliminating the distortions that can take place during the transition between delivery months. For chart analysis purposes, the nearest-month continuation charts published by chart
services are more than adequate. A continuous price series, however, is more useful for back-testing trading systems and indicators.
A more complete explanation of ways to construct continuous
futures contracts is provided by Greg Morris in Appendix D.

LONG TERM TRENDS DISPUTE
RANDOMNESS
The most striking features of long range charts is that not only are
trends very clearly defined, but that long range trends often last for
years. Imagine making a forecast based on one of these long range
trends, and not having to change that forecast for several years!
The persistence of long range trends raises another interesting question that should be mentioned—the question of randomness. While technical analysts do not subscribe to the theory
that market action is random and unpredictable, it seems safe to

www.Fxborssa.com

Long Term Charts

185

observe that whatever randomness does exist in price action is
probably a phenomenon of the very short term. The persistence of
existing trends over long periods of time, in many cases for years, is a
compelling argument against the claims of Random Walk Theorists
that prices are serially independent and that past price action has no
effect on future price action.

PATTERNS ON CHARTS: WEEKLY
AND MONTHLY REVERSALS
Price patterns appear on the long range charts, which are interpreted in the same way as on the daily charts. Double tops and bottoms are very prominent on these charts, as are head and shoulder reversals. Triangles, which are usually continuation patterns,
are frequently seen.
Another pattern that occurs quite frequently on these
charts is the weekly and monthly reversal. For example, on the
monthly chart, a new monthly high followed by a close below the
previous month's close often represents a significant turning
point, especially if it occurs near a major support or resistance
area. Weekly reversals are quite frequent on the weekly charts.
These patterns are the equivalent of the key reversal day on the
daily charts, except that on the long range charts these reversals
carry a great deal more significance.

LONG TERM TO SHORT
TERM CHARTS
It's especially important to appreciate the order in which price charts
should be studied in performing a thorough trend analysis. The
proper order to follow in chart analysis is to begin with the long
range and gradually work to the near term. The reason for this
should become apparent as one works with the different time
dimensions. If the analyst begins with only the near term picture, he
or she is forced to constantly revise conclusions as more price data
is considered. A thorough analysis of a daily chart may have to be
completely redone after looking at the long range charts. By starting

www.Fxborssa.com

186

Chapter 8

with the big picture, going back as far as 20 years, all data to be considered are already included in the chart and a proper perspective is
achieved. Once the analyst knows where the market is from a longer
range perspective, he or she gradually "zeros in" on the shorter term.
The first chart to be considered is the 20 year monthly chart. The
analyst looks for the more obvious chart patterns, major trend-lines,
or the proximity of major support or resistance levels. He or she then
consults the most recent five years on the weekly chart, repeating the
same process. Having done that, the analyst narrows his or her focus
to the last six to nine months of market action on the daily bar chart,
thus going from the "macro" to the "micro" approach. If the trader
wants to proceed further, intraday charts can then be consulted for an
even more microscopic study of recent action.

WHY SHOULD LONG RANGE
CHARTS BE ADJUSTED FOR
INFLATION?
A question often raised concerning long term charts is whether or not
historic price levels seen on the charts should be adjusted for
inflation. After all, the argument goes, do these long range peaks and
troughs have any validity if not adjusted to reflect the changes in the
value of the U.S. dollar? This is a point of some controversy among
analysts.
I do not believe that any adjustment is necessary on these
long range charts for a number of reasons. The main reason is my
belief that the markets themselves have already made the necessary
adjustments. A currency declining in value causes commodities
quoted in that currency to increase in value. The declining value of
the dollar, therefore, would contribute to rising commodity prices. A
rising dollar would cause the price of most commodities to fall.
The tremendous price gains in commodity markets during the
1970s and declining prices in the 1980s and 1990s are classic
examples of inflation at work. To have suggested during the 1970s
that commodity price levels that had doubled and tripled in price
should then be adjusted to reflect rising inflation would make no
sense at all. The rising commodity markets already were a manifestation of that inflation. Declining commodity markets since

www.Fxborssa.com

Long Term Charts

187

the 1980s reflect a long period of disinflation. Should we take the
price of gold, which is now worth less than half of its value in 1980,
and adjust it to reflect the lower inflation rate? The market has
already taken care of that.
The final point in this debate goes to the heart of the technical
theory, which states that price action discounts everything, even
inflation. All financial markets adjust to periods of inflation and
deflation and to changes in currency values. The real answer to
whether long range charts should be adjusted for inflation lies in the
charts themselves. Many markets fail at historic resistance levels set
several years earlier and then bounce off support levels not seen in
several years. It's also clear that falling inflation since the early 1980s
has helped support bull markets in bonds and stocks. It would seem
that those markets have already made their own inflation adjustment.
(See Figure 8.1.)

Figure 8.1 The gold price peak in 1980 ushered in two decades of low
inflation. Low inflation normally causes falling gold prices and rising stock
prices as this chart shows. Why adjust the charts again for inflation? It's
already been done.

Chapter 8

LONG TERM CHARTS NOT
INTENDED FOR TRADING
PURPOSES
Long term charts are not meant for trading purposes. A distinction
has to be made between market analysis for forecasting purposes and
the timing of market commitments. Long term charts are useful in the
analytical process to help determine the major trend and price
objectives. They are not suitable, however, for the timing of entry
and exit points and should not be used for that purpose. For that more
sensitive task, daily and intraday charts should be utilized.

EXAMPLES OF LONG
TERM CHARTS
The following pages contain examples of long term weekly and
monthly charts (Figures 8.2-8.12). The drawings on the charts are
limited to long term support and resistance levels, trendlines, percentage retracements, weekly reversals, and an occasional price
pattern. Be aware, however, that anything that can be done on a daily
chart can also be done on a weekly or monthly. We'll show you later
in the book how the application of various technical indicators to
these long term charts is accomplished, and how signals on weekly
charts become valuable filters for shorter term timing decisions.
Remember also that semilog chart scaling becomes more valuable
when studying long range price trends.

Moving Averages

INTRODUCTION
The moving average is one of the most versatile and widely used of
all technical indicators. Because of the way it is constructed and the
fact that it can be so easily quantified and tested, it is the basis for
many mechanical trend-following systems in use today.
Chart analysis is largely subjective and difficult to test. As a
result, chart analysis does not lend itself that well to computerization.
Moving average rules, by contrast, can easily be programmed into a
computer, which then generates specific buy and sell signals. While
two technicians may disagree as to whether a given price pattern is a
triangle or a wedge, or whether the volume pattern favors the bull or
bear side, moving average trend signals are precise and not open to
debate.
Let's begin by defining what a moving average is. As the second word implies, it is an average of a certain body of data. For
example, if a 10 day average of closing prices is desired, the prices
for the last 10 days are added up and the total is divided by 10. The
term moving is used because only the latest 10 days' prices are

195

www.Fxborssa.com

196

Chapter 9

used in the calculation. Therefore, the body of data to be averaged
(the last 10 closing prices) moves forward with each new trading day.
The most common way to calculate the moving average is to work
from the total of the last 10 days' closing prices. Each day the new
close is added to the total and the close 11 days back is subtracted.
The new total is then divided by the number of days (10). (See Figure
9.1a.)
The above example deals with a simple 10 day moving
average of closing prices. There are, however, other types of moving
averages that are not simple. There are also many questions as to the
best way to employ the moving average. For example, how many
days should be averaged? Should a short term or a long term average
be used? Is there a best moving average for all markets or for each
individual market? Is the closing price the best price to average?
Would it be better to use more than one average?

Figure 9.1a A 10 day moving average applied to a daily bar chart of the
S&P 500. Prices crossed the average line several times (see arrows) before finally
turning higher. Prices stayed above the average during the subsequent rally.

www.Fxborssa.com

Moving Averages

197

Which type of average works better—a simple, linearly weighted or
exponentially smoothed? Are there times when moving averages
work better than others?
There are many questions to be considered when using
moving averages. We'll address many of these questions in this
chapter and show examples of some of the more common usages of
the moving average.

THE MOVING AVERAGE:
A SMOOTHING DEVICE WITH
A TIME LAG
The moving average is essentially a trend following device. Its purpose is to identify or signal that a new trend has begun or that an old
trend has ended or reversed. Its purpose is to track the progress of the
trend. It might be viewed as a curving trendline. It does not, however,
predict market action in the same sense that standard chart analysis
attempts to do. The moving average is a follower, not a leader. It
never anticipates; it only reacts. The moving average follows a
market and tells us that a trend has begun, but only after the fact.
The moving average is a smoothing device. By averaging the
price data, a smoother line is produced, making it much easier to
view the underlying trend. By its very nature, however, the moving
average line also lags the market action. A shorter moving average,
such as a 20 day average, would hug the price action more closely
than a 200 day average. The time lag is reduced with the shorter
averages, but can never be completely eliminated. Shorter term
averages are more sensitive to the price action, whereas longer range
averages are less sensitive. In certain types of markets, it is more
advantageous to use a shorter average and, at other times, a longer
and less sensitive average proves more useful. (See Figure 9.1b.)
Which Prices to Average
We have been using the closing price in all of our examples so far.
However, while the closing price is considered to be the most

Figure 9.1b A comparison of a 20 day and a 200 day moving average. During
the sideways period from August to January, prices crossed the shorter average

the entire period.
important price of the trading day and the price most commonly used
in moving average construction, the reader should be aware that
some technicians prefer to use other prices. Some prefer to use a
midpoint value, which is arrived at by dividing the day's range by
two.
Others include the closing price in their calculation by adding
the high, low, and closing prices together and dividing the sum by
three. Still others prefer to construct price bands by averaging the
high and low prices separately. The result is two separate moving
average lines that act as a sort of volatility buffer or neutral zone.
Despite these variations, the closing price is still the price most
commonly used for moving average analysis and is the price that
we'll be focusing most of our attention on in this chapter.

Moving Averages

199

The Simple Moving Average
The simple moving average, or the arithmetic mean, is the type used
by most technical analysts. But there are some who question its
usefulness on two points. The first criticism is that only the period
covered by the average (the last 10 days, for example) is taken into
account. The second criticism is that the simple moving average gives
equal weight to each day's price. In a 10 day average, the last day
receives the same weight as the first day in the calculation. Each day's
price is assigned a 10% weighting. In a 5 day average, each day
would have an equal 20% weighting. Some analysts believe that a
heavier weighting should be given to the more recent price action.
The Linearly Weighted Moving Average
In an attempt to correct the weighting problem, some analysts employ
a linearly weighted moving average. In this calculation, the closing
price of the 10th day (in the case of a 10 day average) would be
multiplied by 10, the ninth day by nine, the eighth day by eight, and
so on. The greater weight is therefore given to the more recent
closings. The total is then divided by the sum of the multipliers (55 in
the case of the 10 day average: 10 + 9 + 8 + . . . + 1). However, the
linearly weighted average still does not address the problem of
including only the price action covered by the length of the average
itself.
The Exponentially Smoothed
Moving Average
This type of average addresses both of the problems associated with
the simple moving average. First, the exponentially smoothed
average assigns a greater weight to the more recent data. Therefore, it
is a weighted moving average. But while it assigns lesser importance
to past price data, it does include in its calculation all of the data in
the life of the instrument. In addition, the user is able to adjust the
weighting to give greater or lesser weight to the most recent day's
price. This is done by assigning a percentage value to the last day's
price, which is

www.Fxborssa.com

200

Chapter 9

added to a percentage of the previous day's value. The sum of both
percentage values adds up to 100. For example, the last day's price
could be assigned a value of 10% (.10), which is added to the
previous day's value of 90% (.90). That gives the last day 10% of the
total weighting. That would be the equivalent of a 20 day average. By
giving the last day's price a smaller value of 5% (.05), lesser weight is
given to the last day's data and the average is less sensitive. That
would be the equivalent of a 40 day moving average. (See Figure
9.2.)

The Use of One Moving Average
The simple moving average is the one most commonly used by
technicians, and is the one that we'll be concentrating on. Some
traders use just one moving average to generate trend signals. The
moving average is plotted on the bar chart in its appropriate trading
day along with that day's price action. When the closing price moves
above the moving average, a buy signal is generated. A sell signal is
given when prices move below the moving average. For added
confirmation, some technicians also like to see the moving average
line itself turn in the direction of the price crossing. (See Figure 9.3.)
If a very short term average is employed (a 5 or 10 day), the
average tracks prices very closely and several crossings occur. This

Figure 9.3 Prices fell below the 50 day average during October (see left
circle). The sell signal is stronger when the moving average also turns down
(see left arrow). The buy signal during January was confirmed when the average itself turned higher.

action can be either good or bad. The use of a very sensitive average
produces more trades (with higher commission costs) and results in
many false signals (whipsaws). If the average is too sensitive, some
of the short term random price movement (or "noise") activates bad
trend signals.
While the shorter average generates more false signals, it has
the advantage of giving trend signals earlier in the move. It stands to
reason that the more sensitive the average, the earlier the signals will
be. So there is a tradeoff at work here. The trick is to find the average
that is sensitive enough to generate early signals, but insensitive
enough to avoid most of the random "noise." (See Figure 9.4.)

Figure 9.4 A shorter average gives earlier signals. The longer average is
slower, but more reliable. The 10 day turned up first at the bottom. But it
also gave a premature buy signal during 'November and an untimely sell signal
during February (see boxes).

Let's carry the above comparison a step further. While the
longer average performs better while the trend remains in motion, it
"gives back" a lot more when the trend reverses. The very
insensitivity of the longer average (the fact that it trailed the trend
from a greater distance), which kept it from getting tangled up in
short term corrections during the trend, works against the trader when
the trend actually reverses. Therefore, we'll add another corollary
here: The longer averages work better as long as the trend remains in
force, but a shorter average is better when the trend is in the process
of reversing.
It becomes clearer, therefore, that the use of one moving
average alone has several disadvantages. It is usually more advantageous to employ two moving averages.
How to Use Two Averages to
Generate Signals
This technique is called the double crossover method. This means
that a buy signal is produced when the shorter average crosses above
the longer. For example, two popular combinations are the 5 and 20
day averages and the 10 and 50 day averages. In the former, a buy
signal occurs when the 5 day average crosses above the 20, and a sell
signal when the 5 day moves below the 20. In the latter example, the
10 day crossing above the 50 signals an uptrend, and a downtrend
takes place with the 10 slipping under the 50. This technique of using
two averages together lags the market a bit more than the use of a
single average but produces fewer whipsaws. (See Figures 9.5 and
9.6.)

The Use of Three Averages, or the Triple
Crossover Method
That brings us to the triple crossover method. The most widely used
triple crossover system is the popular 4-9-18-day moving average
combination. The 4-9-18 method is used mainly in futures trading.
This concept was first mentioned by R.C. Allen in his 1972 book,
How to Build a Fortune in Commodities and again later in a 1974
work by the same author, How to Use the 4-Day, 9-Day and 18-Day
Moving Averages to Earn Larger Profits from Commodities. The 4-9-18day system is a variation on the 5, 10, and 20 day moving average
numbers, which are widely used in commodity circles. Many
commercial chart services publish the 4-9-18-day moving averages.
(Many charting software packages use the 4-9-18-day combination as
their default values when plotting three averages.)

Sell Signal

Figure 9.6 Stock traders use 10 and 50 day moving averages. The 10 day fell
below the SO day in October (left circle), giving a timely sell signal. The bullish
crossover in the other direction took place during January (lower circle).

How to Use the 4-9-18-Day Moving Average
System
It's already been explained that the shorter the moving average, the
closer it follows the price trend. It stands to reason then that the
shortest of the three averages—the 4 day—will follow the trend most
closely, followed by the 9 day and then the 18. In an uptrend,
therefore, the proper alignment would be for the 4 day average to be
above the 9 day, which is above the 18 day average. In a downtrend,
the order is reversed and the alignment is exactly the opposite. That
is, the 4 day would be the lowest, followed by the 9 day and then the
18 day average. (See Figures 9.7a-b.)
A buying alert takes place in a downtrend when the 4 day
crosses above both the 9 and the 18. A confirmed buy signal occurs
when the 9 day then crosses above the 18. This places the

4 day over the 9 day which is over the 18 day. Some intermingling
may occur during corrections or consolidations, but the general
uptrend remains intact. Some traders may take profits during the
intermingling process and some may use it as a buying opportunity.
There is obviously a lot of room for flexibility here in applying the
rules, depending on how aggressively one wants to trade.
When the uptrend reverses to the downside, the first thing that
should take place is that the shortest (and most sensitive) average—
the 4 day—dips below the 9 day and the 18 day. This is only a selling
alert. Some traders, however, might use that initial crossing as reason
enough to begin liquidating long positions. Then, if the next longer
average—the 9 day—drops below the 18 day, a confirmed sell short
signal is given.

MOVING AVERAGE ENVELOPES
The usefulness of a single moving average can be enhanced by
surrounding it with envelopes. Percentage envelopes can be used to
help determine when a market has gotten overextended in either
direction. In other words, they tell us when prices have strayed too far
from their moving average line. In order to do this, the envelopes are
placed at fixed percentages above and below the average. Shorter
term traders, for example, often use 3% envelopes around a simple 21
day moving average. When prices reach one of the envelopes (3%
from the average), the short term trend is considered to be
overextended. For long range analysis, some possible combinations
include 5% envelopes around a 10 week average or a 10% envelope
around a 40 week average. (See Figures 9.8a-b.)

BOLLINGER BANDS
This technique was developed by John Bollinger. Two trading bands
are placed around a moving average similar to the envelope
technique. Except that Bollinger Bands are placed two standard
deviations above and below the moving average, which is usually 20
days. Standard deviation is a statistical concept that describes how
prices are dispersed around an average value. Using two standard
deviations ensures that 95% of the price data will fall between the
two trading bands. As a rule, prices are considered to be
overextended on the upside (overbought) when they touch the upper
band. They are considered overextended on the downside (oversold)
when they touch the lower band. (See Figures 9.9a-b.)

Figure 9.9a Bollinger bands plotted around a 20 day moving average.
During the sideways period from August to January, prices kept touching the
outer bands. Once the uptrend resumed, prices traded between the upper band
and 20 day average.

www.Fxborssa.com

270

Chapter 9

Figure 9.9b Bollinger bands work on weekly charts as well, by using a 20
week average as the middle line. Each touch of the lower band (see circles)
signaled an important market bottom and a buying opportunity.

USING BOLLINGER BANDS AS
TARGETS
The simplest way to use Bollinger Bands is to use the upper and
lower bands as price targets. In other words, if prices bounce off the
lower band and cross above the 20 day average, the upper band
becomes the upper price target. A crossing below the 20 day average
would identify the lower band as the downside target. In a strong
uptrend, prices will usually fluctuate between the upper band and the
20 day average. In that case, a crossing below the 20 day average
warns of a trend reversal to the downside.

Moving Averages

211

BAND WIDTH MEASURES
VOLATILITY
Bollinger Bands differ from envelopes in one major way. Whereas
the envelopes stay a constant percentage width apart, Bollinger
Bands expand and contract based on the last 20 days' volatility.
During a period of rising price volatility, the distance between the
two bands will widen. Conversely, during a period of low market
volatility, the distance between the two bands will contract. There is a
tendency for the bands to alternate between expansion and
contraction. When the bands are unusually far apart, that is often a
sign that the current trend may be ending. When the distance between
the two bands has narrowed too far, that is often a sign that a market
may be about to initiate a new trend. Bollinger Bands can also be
applied to weekly and monthly price charts by using 20 weeks and 20
months instead of 20 days. Bollinger Bands work best when
combined with overbought/oversold oscillators that are explained in
the next chapter. (See Appendix A for additional band techniques.)

Centering the Average
The more statistically correct way to plot a moving average is to
center it. That means to place it in the middle of the time period it
covers. A 10 day average, for example, would be placed five days
back. A 20 day average would be plotted 10 days back in time.
Centering the average, however, has the major flaw of producing
much later trend change signals. Therefore, moving averages are
usually placed at the end of the time period covered instead of the
middle. The centering technique is used almost exclusively by cyclic
analysts to isolate underlying market cycles.

Chapter 9

MOVING AVERAGES TIED TO
CYCLES
Many market analysts believe that time cycles play an important role
in market movement. Because these time cycles are repetitive and
can be measured, it is possible to determine the approximate times
when market tops or bottoms will occur. Many different time cycles
exist simultaneously, from a short term 5 day cycle to Kondratieff's
long 54 year cycle. We'll delve more into this fascinating branch of
technical analysis in Chapter 14.
The subject of cycles is introduced here only to make the
point that there seems to be a relationship between the underlying
cycles that affect a certain market and the correct moving averages to
use. In other words, the moving averages can be adjusted to fit the
dominant cycles in each market.
There appears to be a definite relationship between moving
averages and cycles. For example, the monthly cycle is one of the
best known cycles operating throughout the commodity markets. A
month has 20-21 trading days. Cycles tend to be related to their next
longer and shorter cycles harmonically, or by a factor of two. That
means that the next longer cycle is double the length of a cycle and
the next shorter cycle is half its length.
The monthly cycle, therefore, may explain the popularity of
the 5,10,20, and 40 day moving averages. The 20 day cycle measures
the monthly cycle. The 40 day average is double the 20 day. The 10
day average is half of 20 and the 5 day average is half again of 10.
Many of the more commonly used moving averages
(including the 4, 9, and 18 day averages, which are derivatives of 5,
10, and 20) can be explained by cyclic influences and the harmonic
relationships of neighboring cycles. Incidentally, the 4 week cycle
may also help explain the success of the 4 week rule, covered later in
the chapter, and its shorter counterpart—the 2 week rule.

FIBONACCI NUMBERS USED AS
MOVING AVERAGES
We'll cover the Fibonacci number series in the chapter on Elliott
Wave Theory. However, I'd like to mention here that this mysterious
series of numbers—such as 13, 21, 34, 55, and so on—seem to lend
themselves quite well to moving average analysis. This is

true not only of daily charts, but for weekly charts as well. The 21
day moving average is a Fibonacci number. On the weekly charts, the
13 week average has proven valuable in both stocks and commodities. We'll postpone a more in depth discussion of these numbers
until Chapter 13.

MOVING AVERAGES APPLIED TO
LONG TERM CHARTS
The reader should not overlook using this technique in longer range
trend analysis. Longer range moving averages, such as 10 or 13
weeks, in conjunction with the 30 or 40 week average, have long
been used in stock market analysis, but haven't been given as much
attention in the futures markets. The 10 and 40 week moving
averages can be used to help track the primary trend on weekly charts
for futures and stocks. (See Figure 9.10.)

week moving average should provide support during bull market corrections
as it did here.

Some Pros and Cons of the Moving Average
One of the great advantages of using moving averages, and one of the
reasons they are so popular as trend-following systems, is that they
embody some of the oldest maxims of successful trading. They trade
in the direction of the trend. They let profits run and cut losses short.
The moving average system forces the user to obey those rules by
providing specific buy and sell signals based on those principles.
Because they are trend-following in nature, however, moving
averages work best when markets are in a trending period. They
perform very poorly when markets get choppy and trade sideways for
a period of time. And that might be a third to a half of the time.
The fact that they do not work that well for significant periods
of time, however, is one very compelling reason why it is dangerous
to rely too heavily on the moving average technique. In certain
trending markets, the moving average can't be beat. Just switch the
program to automatic. At other times, a nontrending method like the
overbought-oversold oscillator is more appropriate. (In Chapter 15,
we'll show you an indicator called ADX that tells you when a market
is trending and when it is not, and whether the market climate favors
a trending moving average technique or a nontrending oscillator
approach.)
Moving Averages As Oscillators
One way to construct an oscillator is to compare the difference
between two moving averages. The use of two moving averages in
the double crossover method, therefore, takes on greater significance
and becomes an even more useful technique. We'll see how this is
done in Chapter 10. One method compares two exponentially
smoothed averages. That method is called Moving Average
Convergence/Divergence (MACD). It is used partially as an
oscillator. Therefore, we'll postpone our explanation of that technique
until we deal with the entire subject of oscillators in Chapter 10.

The Moving Average Applied to Other
Technical Data
The moving average can be applied to virtually any technical data or
indicator. It can be used on open interest and volume figures,
including on balance volume. The moving average can be used on
various indicators and ratios. It can be applied to oscillators as well.

THE WEEKLY RULE
There are other alternatives to the moving average as a trend-following device. One of the best known and most successful of these
techniques is called the weekly price channel or, simply, the weekly
rule. This technique has many of the benefits of the moving average,
but is less time consuming and simpler to use.
With the improvements in computer technology over the past
decade, a considerable amount of research has been done on the
development of technical trading systems. These systems are
mechanical in nature, meaning that human emotion and judgment are
eliminated. These systems have become increasingly sophisticated.
At first, simple moving averages were utilized. Then, double and
triple crossovers of the averages were added. The averages were then
linearly weighted and exponentially smoothed. These systems are
primarily trend-following, which means their purpose is to identify
and then trade in the direction of an existing trend.
With the increased fascination with fancier and more complex
systems and indicators, however, there has been a tendency to
overlook some of the simpler techniques that continue to work quite
well and have stood the test of time. We're going to discuss one of
the simplest of these techniques—the weekly rule.
In 1970, a booklet entitled the Trader's Notebook was published by Dunn & Hargitt's Financial Services in Lafayette, Indiana.
The best known commodity trading systems of the day were
computer-tested and compared. The final conclusion of all that
research was that the most successful of all the systems tested was the
4 week rule, developed by Richard Donchian. Mr.

www.Fxborssa.com

216

Chapter 9

Donchian has been recognized as a pioneer in the field of commodity
trend trading using mechanical systems. (In 1983, Managed Account
Reports chose Donchian as the first recipient of the Most Valuable
Performer Award for outstanding contributions to the field of futures
money management, and presents The Donchian Award to other
worthy recipients.)
More recent work done by Louis Lukac, former research
director at Dunn & Hargitt and currently president of Wizard Trading
(a Massachusetts CTA) supports the earlier conclusions that breakout
(or channel) systems similar to the weekly rule continue to show
superior results. (Lukac et al.)*
Of the 12 systems tested from 1975-84, only 4 generated
significant profits. Of those 4, 2 were channel breakout systems and
one was a dual moving average crossover system. A later article by
Lukac and Brorsen in The Financial Review (November 1990)
published the results of a more extensive study done on data from
1976-86 that compared 23 technical trading systems. Once again,
channel breakouts and moving average systems came out on top.
Lukac finally concluded that a channel breakout system was his
personal choice as the best starting point for all technical trading
system testing and development.
The 4 Week Rule
The 4 week rule is used primarily for futures trading.
The system based on the 4 week rule is simplicity itself:
1. Cover short positions and buy long whenever the price
exceeds the highs of the four preceding full calendar weeks.
2. Liquidate long positions and sell short whenever the price falls
below the lows of the four preceding full calendar weeks.
The system, as it is presented here, is continuous in nature,
which means that the trader always has a position, either long or
short. As a general rule, continuous systems have a basic weakness.
They stay in the market and get "whipsawed" during trendless market
periods. It's already been stressed that trend-following systems do not
work well when markets are in these sideways, or trendless phases.
* See Bibliography

www.Fxborssa.com

Moving Averages

217

The 4 week rule can be modified to make it noncontinu-ous.
This can be accomplished by using a shorter time span—such as a
one or two week rule—for liquidation purposes. In other words, a
four week "breakout" would be necessary to initiate a new position,
but a one or two week signal in the opposite direction would warrant
liquidation of the position. The trader would then remain out of the
market until a new four week breakout is registered.
The logic behind the system is based on sound technical
principles. Its signals are mechanical and clearcut. Because it is trend
following, it virtually guarantees participation on the right side of
every important trend. It is also structured to follow the often quoted
maxim of successful trading—"let profits run, while cutting losses
short." Another feature, which should not be overlooked, is that this
method tends to trade less frequently, so that commissions are lower.
Another plus is that the system can be implemented with or without
the aid of a computer.
The main criticism of the weekly rule is the same one leveled
against all trend-following approaches, namely, that it does not catch
tops or bottoms. But what trend-following system does? The
important point to keep in mind is that the four week rule performs at
least as well as most other trend-following systems and better than
many, but has the added benefit of incredible simplicity.
Adjustments to the 4 Week Rule
Although we're treating the four week rule in its original form, there
are many adjustments and refinements that can be employed. For one
thing, the rule does not have to be used as a trading system. Weekly
signals can be employed simply as another technical indicator to
identify breakouts and trend reversals. Weekly breakouts can be used
as a confirming filter for other techniques, such as moving average
crossovers. One or 2 week rules function as excellent filters. A
moving average crossover signal could be confirmed by a two week
breakout in the same direction in order for a market position to be
taken.

218

Chapter 9

Shorten or Lengthen Time Periods for
Sensitivity
The time period employed can be expanded or compressed in the
interests of risk management and sensitivity. For example, the time
period could be shortened if it is desirable to make the system more
sensitive. In a relatively high priced market, where prices are
trending sharply higher, a shorter time span could be chosen to make
the system more sensitive. Suppose, for example, that a long position
is taken on a 4 week upside breakout with a protective stop placed
just below the low of the past 2 weeks. If the market has rallied
sharply and the trader wishes to trail the position with a closer
protective stop, a one week stopout point could be used.
In a trading range situation, where a trend trader would just as
soon stay on the sidelines until an important trend signal is given, the
time period could be expanded to eight weeks. This would prevent
taking positions on shorter term and premature trend signals.
The 4 Week Rule Tied to Cycles
Earlier in the chapter reference was made to the importance of the
monthly cycle in commodity markets. The 4 week, or 20 day, trading
cycle is a dominant cycle that influences all markets. This may help
explain why the 4 week time period has proven so successful. Notice
that mention was made of 1, 2, and 8 week rules. The principle of
harmonics in cyclic analysis holds that each cycle is related to its
neighboring cycles (next longer and next shorter cycles) by 2.
In the previous discussion of moving averages, it was pointed
out how the monthly cycle and harmonics explained the popularity of
the 5,10, 20, and 40 day moving averages. The same time periods
hold true in the realm of weekly rules. Those daily numbers
translated into weekly time periods are 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks.
Therefore, adjustments to the 4 week rule seem to work best when
the beginning number (4) is divided or multiplied by 2. To shorten
the time span, go from 4 to 2 weeks. If an even shorter time span is
desired, go from 2 to 1. To lengthen, go from

www.Fxborssa.com

219

Moving Averages

4 to 8. Because this method combines price and time, there's no
reason why the cyclic principle of harmonics should not play an
important role. The tactic of dividing a weekly parameter by 2 to
shorten it, or doubling it to lengthen it, does have cycle logic behind
it.
The 4 week rule is a simple breakout system. The original
system can be modified by using a shorter time period—a 1 or 2
week rule—for liquidation purposes. If the user desires a more sensitive system, a 2 week period can be employed for entry signals.
Because this rule is meant to be simple, it is best addressed on that
level. The 4 week rule is simple, but it works.(Charting packages
allow you to plot price channels above and below current prices to
spot channel breakouts. Price channels can be used on daily, weekly,
or monthly charts. See Figures 9.11 and 9.12.)

TO OPTIMIZE OR NOT
The first edition of this book included the results of extensive
research produced by Merrill Lynch, which published a series of
studies on computerized trading techniques applied to the futures
markets from 1978-82. Extensive testing of various moving average
and channel breakout parameters was performed to find the best
possible combinations in each futures market. The Merrill Lynch
researchers produced a different set of optimized indicator values for
each market.
Most charting packages allow you to optimize systems and
indicators. Instead of using the same moving average in all markets,
for example, you could ask the computer to find the moving average,
or moving average combinations, that have worked the best in the
past for that market. That could also be done for daily

www.Fxborssa.com

Moving Averages

221

and weekly breakout systems and virtually all technical indicators
included in this book. Optimization allows technical parameters to
adapt to changing market conditions.
Some argue that optimization helps their trading results and
others that it doesn't. The heart of the debate centers on how the data
is optimized. Researchers stress that the correct procedure is to use
only part of the price data to choose the best parameters, and another
portion to actually test the results. Testing the optimized parameters
on "out of sample" price data helps ensure that the final results will
be closer to what one might experience from actual trading.
The decision to optimize or not is a personal one. Most evidence, however, suggests that optimization is not the Holy Grail
some think it to be. I generally advise traders following only a
handful of markets to experiment with optimization. Why should
Treasury Bonds or the German mark have the exact same moving
averages as corn or cotton? Stock market traders are a different story.
Having to follow thousands of stocks argues against optimizing. If
you specialize in a handful of markets, try optimizing. If you're a
generalist who follows a large number of markets, use the same
technical parameters for all of them.

SUMMARY
We've presented a lot of variations on the moving average approach.
Let's try to simplify things a bit. Most technicians use a combination
of two moving averages. Those two averages are usually simple
averages. Although exponential averages have become popular,
there's no real evidence to prove that they work any better than the
simple average. The most commonly used daily moving average
combinations in futures markets are 4 and 9, 9 and 18, 5 and 20, and
10 and 40. Stock traders rely heavily on a 50 day (or 10 week)
moving average. For longer range stock market analysis, popular
weekly moving averages are 30 and 40 weeks (or 200 days).
Bollinger Bands make use of 20 day and 20 week moving averages.
The 20 week average can be converted to daily charts by utilizing a
100 day average, which is another use-

ful moving average. Channel breakout systems work extremely well
in trending markets and can be used on daily, weekly, and monthly
charts.

THE ADAPTIVE
MOVING AVERAGE
One of the problems encountered with the moving average is
choosing between a fast or a slow average. While one may work
better in a trading range market, the other may be preferable in a
trending market. The answer to the problem of choosing between the
two may lie with an innovative approach called the "adaptive moving
average."
Perry Kaufman presents this technique in his book Smarter
Trading. The speed of Kaufman's "adaptive moving average" automatically adjusts to the level of noise (or volatility) in a market. The
AMA moves more slowly when markets are trending sideways, but
then moves more swiftly when the market is trending. That avoids
the problem of using a faster moving average (and getting whipsawed
more frequently) during a trading range, and using a slower average
that trails too far behind a market when it is trending.
Kaufman does that by constructing an Efficiency Ratio that
compares price direction with the level of volatility. When the
Efficiency Ratio is high, there is more direction than volatility
(favoring a faster average). When the ratio is low, there's more
volatility than direction (favoring a slower average). By incorporating the Efficiency Ratio, the AMA automatically adjusts to the
speed most suitable for the current market.

ALTERNATIVES TO THE
MOVING AVERAGE
Moving averages don't work all of the time. They do their best work
when the market is in a trending phase. They're not very helpful
during trendless periods when prices trade sideways. Fortunately,
there's another class of indicator that performs much better than the
moving average during those frustrating trading ranges. They're
called oscillators and we'll explain them in the next chapter.

INTRODUCTION
In this chapter, we're going to talk about an alternative to trendfollowing approaches—the oscillator. The oscillator is extremely
useful in nontrending markets where prices fluctuate in a horizontal
price band, or trading range, creating a market situation where most
trend-following systems simply don't work that well. The oscillator
provides the technical trader with a tool that can enable him or her to
profit from these periodic sideways and trendless market
environments.
The value of the oscillator is not limited to horizontal trading
ranges, however. Used in conjunction with price charts during
trending phases, the oscillator becomes an extremely valuable ally by
alerting the trader to short term market extremes, commonly referred
to as overbought or oversold conditions. The oscillator can also warn
that a trend is losing momentum before that situation

225

www.Fxborssa.com

226

Chapter 10

becomes evident in the price action itself. Oscillators can signal that a
trend may be nearing completion by displaying certain divergences.
We'll begin by explaining first what an oscillator is and the
basis for its construction and interpretation. We'll then discuss the
meaning of momentum and its implications for market forecasting.
Some of the more common oscillator techniques will be presented
from the very simple to the more complicated. The important
question of divergence will be covered. We'll touch on the value of
coordinating oscillator analysis with underlying market cycles.
Finally, we'll discuss how oscillators should be used as part of the
overall technical analysis of a market.

OSCILLATOR USAGE IN
CONJUNCTION WITH TREND
The oscillator is only a secondary indicator in the sense that it must
be subordinated to basic trend analysis. As we go through the various
types of oscillators used by technicians, the importance of trading in
the direction of the overriding market trend will be constantly
stressed. The reader should also be aware that there are times when
oscillators are more useful than at others. For example, near the
beginning of important moves, oscillator analysis isn't that helpful
and can even be misleading. Toward the end of market moves,
however, oscillators become extremely valuable. We'll address these
points as we go along. Finally, no study of market extremes would be
complete without a discussion of Contrary Opinion. We'll talk about
the role of the contrarian philosophy and how it can be incorporated
into market analysis and trading.
Interpretation of Oscillators
While there are many different ways to construct momentum
oscillators, the actual interpretation differs very little from one
technique to another. Most oscillators look very much alike. They are
plotted along the bottom of the price chart and resemble a flat
horizontal band. The oscillator band is basically flat while prices

www.Fxborssa.com

Oscillators and Contrary Opinion

227

may be trading up, down, or sideways. However, the peaks and
troughs in the oscillator coincide with the peaks and troughs on the
price chart. Some oscillators have a midpoint value that divides the
horizontal range into two halves, an upper and a lower. Depending on
the formula used, this midpoint line is usually a zero line. Some
oscillators also have upper and lower boundaries ranging from 0 to
100.
General Rules for Interpretation
As a general rule, when the oscillator reaches an extreme value in
either the upper or lower end of the band, this suggests that the
current price move may have gone too far too fast and is due for a
correction or consolidation of some type. As another general rule, the
trader should be buying when the oscillator line is in the lower end of
the band and selling in the upper end. The crossing of the midpoint
line is often used to generate buy and sell signals. We'll see how these
general rules are applied as we deal with the various types of
oscillators.
The Three Most Important Uses for the
Oscillator
There are three situations when the oscillator is most useful. You'll
see that these three situations are common to most types of oscillators
that are used.
1. The oscillator is most useful when its value reaches an
extreme reading near the upper or lower end of its boundaries.
The market is said to be overbought when it is near the upper
extreme and oversold when it is near the lower extreme. This
warns that the price trend is overextended and vulnerable.
2. A divergence between the oscillator and the price action when
the oscillator is in an extreme position is usually an important
warning.
3. The crossing of the zero (or midpoint) line can give important
trading signals in the direction of the price trend.

MEASURING MOMENTUM
The concept of momentum is the most basic application of oscillator
analysis. Momentum measures the velocity of price changes as
opposed to the actual price levels themselves. Market momentum is
measured by continually taking price differences for a fixed time
interval. To construct a 10 day momentum line, simply subtract the
closing price 10 days ago from the last closing price. This positive or
negative value is then plotted around a zero line. The formula for
momentum is:
M = V - Vx
where V is the latest closing price and Vx is the closing price x days
ago.

Figure 10.1b .4 comparison of 10 and 40 day momentum lines. The
longer version is more helpful in catching major market turns (see circles).

If the latest closing price is greater than that of 10 days ago
(in other words, prices have moved higher), then a positive value
would be plotted above the zero line. If the latest close is below the
close 10 days earlier (prices have declined), then a negative value is
plotted below the zero line.
While the 10 day momentum is a commonly used time period
for reasons discussed later, any time period can be employed. (See
Figure 10.1a.) A shorter time period (such as 5 days) produces a more
sensitive line with more pronounced oscillations. A longer number of
days (such as 40 days) results in a much smoother line in which the
oscillator swings are less volatile. (See Figure 10.1b.)

Chapter 10

Momentum Measures Rates of Ascent
or Descent
Let's talk a bit more about just what this momentum indicator is
measuring. By plotting price differences for a set period of time, the
chartist is studying rates of ascent or descent. If prices are rising and
the momentum line is above the zero line and rising, this means the
uptrend is accelerating. If the up-slanting momentum line begins to
flatten out, this means that the new gains being achieved by the latest
closes are the same as the gains 10 days earlier. While prices may
still be advancing, the rate of ascent (or the velocity) has leveled off.
When the momentum line begins to drop toward the zero line, the
uptrend in prices is still in force, but at a decelerating rate. The
uptrend is losing momentum.
When the momentum line moves below the zero line, the
latest 10 day close is now under the close of 10 days ago and a near
term downtrend is in effect. (And, incidentally, the 10 day moving
average also has begun to decline.) As momentum continues to drop
farther below the zero line, the downtrend gains momentum. Only
when the line begins to advance again does the analyst know that the
downtrend is decelerating.
It's important to remember that momentum measures the
differences between prices at two time intervals. In order for the line
to advance, the price gains for the last day's close must be greater
than the gains of 10 days ago. If prices advance by only the same
amount as 10 days ago, the momentum line will be flat. If the last
price gain is less than that of 10 days ago, the momentum line begins
to decline even though prices are still rising. This is how the
momentum line measures the acceleration or deceleration in the
current advance or decline in the price trend.
The Momentum Line Leads the Price Action
Because of the way it is constructed, the momentum line is always a
step ahead of the price movement. It leads the advance or decline in
prices, then levels off while the current price trend is still in effect. It
then begins to move in the opposite direction as prices begin to level
off.

The Crossing of the Zero Line as a
Trading Signal
The momentum chart has a zero line. Many technicians use the
crossing of the zero line to generate buy and sell signals. A crossing
above the zero line would be a buy signal, and a crossing below the
zero line, a sell signal. It should be stressed here again, however, that
basic trend analysis is still the overriding consideration. Oscillator
analysis should not be used as an excuse to trade against the
prevailing market trend. Buy positions should only be taken on
crossings above the zero line if the market trend is up. Short positions
should be taken on crossings below the zero line only if the price
trend is down. (See Figures 10.2a and b.)

Figure 10.2b Some traders regard a crossing above the zero line as a
buy signal and a crossing below the line as a sell signal (see circles). A
moving average is helpful to confirm trend changes. The momentum line
peaked before the price (see arrows).

The Need for an Upper and
Lower Boundary
One problem with the momentum line, as it is described here, is the
absence of a fixed upper and lower boundary. It was stated earlier
that one of the major values of oscillator analysis is being able to
determine when markets are in extreme areas. But, how high is too
high and how low is too low on the momentum line? The simplest
way to solve this problem is by visual inspection. Check the back
history of the momentum line on the chart and draw horizontal lines
along its upper and lower boundaries. These lines will have to be
adjusted periodically, especially after important trend changes have
occurred. But it is the simplest and probably the most effective way
of identifying the outer extremities. (See Figures 10.3 and 10.4.)

Chapter 10

MEASURING RATE OF
CHANGE (ROC)
To measure the rate of change, a ratio is constructed of the most
recent closing price to a price a certain number of days in the past. To
construct a 10 day rate of change oscillator, the latest closing price is
divided by the close 10 days ago. The formula is as follows:
Rate of change =100 (V/V*)
where V is the latest close and Vx is the closing price x days ago. In
this case, the 100 line becomes the midpoint line. If the latest price is
higher than the price 10 days ago (prices are rising), the resulting rate
of change value will be above 100. If the last close is below 10 days
ago, the ratio would be below 100. (Charting software sometimes
uses variations of the preceding formulas for momentum and rate of
change. While the construction techniques may vary, the
interpretation remains the same.)

CONSTRUCTING AN OSCILLATOR
USING TWO MOVING AVERAGES
Chapter 9 discussed two moving averages being used to generate buy
and sell signals. The crossing of the shorter average above or below
the longer average registered buy and sell signals, respectively. It
was mentioned at that time that these dual moving average
combinations could also be used to construct oscillator charts. This
can be done by plotting the difference between the two averages as a
histogram. These histogram bars appear as a plus or minus value
around a centered zero line. This type of oscillator has three uses:
1. To help spot divergences.
2. To help identify short term variations from the long term
trend, when the shorter average moves too far above or below
the longer average.

www.Fxborssa.com

Oscillators and Contrary Opinion

235

3. To pinpoint the crossings of the two moving averages, which
occur when the oscillator crosses the zero line.
The shorter average is divided by the longer. In both cases,
however, the shorter average oscillates around the longer average,
which is in effect the zero line. If the shorter average is above the
longer, the oscillator would be positive. A negative reading would be
present if the shorter average were under the longer. (See Figures
10.5-10.7.)
When the two moving average lines move too far apart, a
market extreme is created calling for a pause in the trend. (See Figure
10.6.) Very often, the trend remains stalled until the shorter average
line moves back to the longer. When the

signals (see arrows). Notice that the histogram turns well before the actual

shorter line approaches the longer, a critical point is reached. In an
uptrend, for example, the shorter line dips back to the longer average,
but should bounce off it. This usually represents an ideal buying area.
It's much like the testing of an up trendline. If the shorter average
crosses below the longer average, however, a trend reversal is
signaled.
In a downtrend, a rise in the shorter average to the longer
usually represents an ideal selling area unless the longer line is
crossed, in which case a trend reversal signal would be registered.
The relationships between the two averages can be used, therefore,
not only as an excellent trend-following system, but also to help
identify short term overbought and oversold conditions.

COMMODITY CHANNEL INDEX
It is possible to normalize an oscillator by dividing the values by a
constant divisor. In the construction of his Commodity Channel Index
(CO), Donald R. Lambert compares the current price with a moving
average over a selected time span—usually 20 days. He then
normalizes the oscillator values by using a divisor based on mean
deviation. As a result, the CCI fluctuates in a constant range from
+100 on the upside to -100 on the downside. Lambert recommended
long positions in those markets with values over +100. Markets with
CCI values below -100 were candidates for short sales.

www.Fxborssa.com

238

Chapter 10

It seems, however, that most chartists use CCI simply as an
overbought/oversold oscillator. Used in that fashion readings over
+100 are considered overbought and under -100 are oversold. While
the Commodity Channel Index was originally developed for
commodities, it is also used for trading stock index futures and
options like the S&P 100 (OEX). Although 20 days is the common
default value for CCI, the user can vary the number to adjust its
sensitivity. (See Figures 10.8 and 10.9.)

THE RELATIVE STRENGTH
INDEX (RSI)
The RSI was developed by J. Welles Wilder, Jr. and presented in his
1978 book, New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems. We're only
going to cover the main points here. A reading of the original work
by Wilder himself is recommended for a more in-depth treatment.
Because this particular oscillator is so popular among traders, we'll
use it to demonstrate most of the principles of oscillator analysis.
As Wilder points out, one of the two major problems in
constructing a momentum line (using price differences) is the erratic
movement often caused by sharp changes in the values being dropped
off. A sharp advance or a decline 10 days ago (in the case of a 10 day
momentum line) can cause sudden shifts in

www.Fxborssa.com

240

Chapter 10

the momentum line even if the current prices show little change.
Some smoothing is therefore necessary to minimize these distortions.
The second problem is that there is the need for a constant range for
comparison purposes. The RSI formula not only provides the
necessary smoothing, but also solves the latter problem by creating a
constant vertical range of 0 to 100.
The term "relative strength," incidentally, is a misnomer and
often causes confusion among those more familiar with that term as it
is used in stock market analysis. Relative strength generally means a
ratio line comparing two different entities. A ratio of a stock or
industry group to the S&P 500 Index is one way of gauging the
relative strength of different stocks or industry groups against one
objective benchmark. We'll show you later in the book how useful
relative strength or ratio analysis can be. Wilder's Relative Strength
Index doesn't really measure the relative strength between different
entities and, in that sense, the name is somewhat misleading. The
RSI, however, does solve the problem of erratic movement and the
need for a constant upper and lower boundary. The actual formula is
calculated as follows:
RSI 100

= -TT5s

R<; _

Average of x days' up closes ~~
Average of x days' down closes

Fourteen days are used in the calculation; 14 weeks are used
for weekly charts. To find the average up value, add the total points
gained on up days during the 14 days and divide that total by 14. To
find the average down value, add the total number of points lost
during the down days and divide that total by 14. Relative strength
(RS) is then determined by dividing the up average by the down
average. That RS value is then inserted into the formula for RSI. The
number of days can be varied by simply changing the value of x.
Wilder originally employed a 14 day period. The shorter the
time period, the more sensitive the oscillator becomes and the wider its
amplitude. RSI works best when its fluctuations reach the upper

241

Oscillators and Contrary Opinion

and lower extremes. Therefore, if the user is trading on a very short
term basis and wants the oscillator swings to be more pronounced,
the time period can be shortened. The time period is lengthened to
make the oscillator smoother and narrower in amplitude. The
amplitude in the 9 day oscillator is therefore greater than the original
14 day. While 9 and 14 day spans are the most common values used,
technicians experiment with other periods. Some use shorter lengths,
such as 5 or 7 days, to increase the volatility of the RSI line. Others
use 21 or 28 days to smooth out the RSI signals. (See Figures 10.10
and 10.11.)

Chapter 10

Figure 10.11 The amplitude of the RSI line can be widened by shortening the
time period. Notice that the 7 day RSI reaches the outer extremes more
frequently than the 14 day RSI. That makes the 7 day RSI more useful to short
term traders.

Interpreting RSI
RSI is plotted on a vertical scale of 0 to 100. Movements above 70
are considered overbought, while an oversold condition would be a
move under 30. Because of shifting that takes place in bull and bear
markets, the 80 level usually becomes the overbought level in bull
markets and the 20 level the oversold level in bear markets.
"Failure swings," as Wilder calls them, occur when the RSI is
above 70 or under 30. A top failure swing occurs when a peak in the
RSI (over 70) fails to exceed a previous peak in an uptrend, followed
by a downside break of a previous trough. A bottom failure swing
occurs when the RSI is in a downtrend (under 30), fails to set a new
low, and then proceeds to exceed a previous peak. (See Figures
10.12a-b.)

Chapter 10

Divergence between the RSI and the price line, when the RSI
is above 70 or below 30, is a serious warning that should be heeded.
Wilder himself considers divergence "the single most indicative
characteristic of the Relative Strength Index" [Wilder, p. 70].
Trendline analysis can be employed to detect changes in the
trend of the RSI. Moving averages can also be used for the same
purpose. (See Figure 10.13.)

Figure 10.13 Trendlines work very effectively on the RSI line. The breaking
of the two RSI trendlines gave timely buy and sell signals on this chart (see
arrows).

In my own personal experience with the RSI oscillator, its
greatest value lies in failure swings or divergences that occur when
the RSI is over 70 or under 30. Let's clarify another important point
on the use of oscillators. Any strong trend, either up or down, usually
produces an extreme oscillator reading before

www.Fxborssa.com

Oscillators and Contrary Opinion

too long. In such cases, claims that a market is overbought or
oversold are usually premature and can lead to an early exit from a
profitable trend. In strong uptrends, overbought markets can stay
overbought for some time. Just because the oscillator has moved into
the upper region is not reason enough to liquidate a long position (or,
even worse, short into the strong uptrend).
The first move into the overbought or oversold region is
usually just a warning. The signal to pay close attention to is the
second move by the oscillator into the danger zone. If the second
move fails to confirm the price move into new highs or new lows
(forming a double top or bottom on the oscillator), a possible
divergence exists. At that point, some defensive action can be taken
to protect existing positions. If the oscillator moves in the opposite
direction, breaking a previous high or low, then a divergence or
failure swing is confirmed.
The 50 level is the RSI midpoint value, and will often act as
support during pullbacks and resistance during bounces. Some traders
treat RSI crossings above and below the 50 level as buying and
selling signals respectively.

USING THE 70 AND 30 LINES TO
GENERATE SIGNALS
Horizontal lines appear on the oscillator chart at the 70 and 30 values.
Traders often use those lines to generate buy and sell signals. We
already know that a move under 30 warns of an oversold condition.
Suppose the trader thinks a market is about to bottom and is looking
for a buying opportunity. He or she watches the oscillator dip under
30. Some type of divergence or double bottom may develop in the
oscillator in that oversold region. A crossing back above the 30 line at
that point is taken by many traders as a confirmation that the trend in
the oscillator has turned up. Accordingly, in an overbought market, a
crossing back under the 70 line can often be used as a sell signal. (See
Figure 10.14.)

Figure 10.14 The RSI oscillator can be used on monthly charts. Notice the
two major oversold buy signals in 1974 and 1994. The overbought peaks in
the RSI line did a pretty good job of pinpointing important tops in the utilities.

STOCHASTICS (K%D)
The Stochastic oscillator was popularized by George Lane (president
of Investment Educators, Inc., Watseka, IL). It is based on the
observation that as prices increase, closing prices tend to be closer to
the upper end of the price range. Conversely, in downtrends, the
closing price tends to be near the lower end of the range. Two lines
are used in the Stochastic Process—the %K line and the %D line.
The %D line is the more important and is the one that provides the
major signals.
The intent is to determine where the most recent closing price
is in relation to the price range for a chosen time period. Fourteen is
the most common period used for this oscillator. To determine the K
line, which is the more sensitive of the two, the formula is:
%K = 100 [(C - L14) / (H14 - L14)]

www.Fxborssa.com

Oscillators and Contrary Opinion

247

where C is the latest close, L14 is the lowest low for the last 14
periods, and H14 is the highest high for the same 14 periods (14
periods can refer to days, weeks, or months).
The formula simply measures, on a percentage basis of 0 to
100, where the closing price is in relation to the total price range for a
selected time period. A very high reading (over 80) would put the
closing price near the top of the range, while a low reading (under 20)
near the bottom of the range.
The second line (%D) is a 3 period moving average of the %K
line. This formula produces a version called fast stochastics. By
taking another 3 period average of %D, a smoother version called
slow stochastics is computed. Most traders use the slow stochastics
because of its more reliable signals.*
These formulas produce two lines that oscillate between a
vertical scale from 0 to 100. The K line is a faster line, while the D
line is a slower line. The major signal to watch for is a divergence
between the D line and the price of the underlying market when the D
line is in an overbought or oversold area. The upper and lower
extremes are the 80 and 20 values. (See Figure 10.15.)
A bearish divergence occurs when the D line is over 80 and
forms two declining peaks while prices continue to move higher. A
bullish divergence is present when the D line is under 20 and forms
two rising bottoms while prices continue to move lower. Assuming
all of these factors are in place, the actual buy or sell signal is
triggered when the faster K line crosses the slower D line.
There are other refinements in the use of Stochastics, but this
explanation covers the more essential points. Despite the higher level
of sophistication, the basic oscillator interpretation remains the same.
An alert or set-up is present when the %D line is in an extreme area
and diverging from the price action. The actual signal takes place
when the D line is crossed by the faster K line.
The Stochastic oscillator can be used on weekly and monthly
charts for longer range perspective. It can also be used effectively on
intraday charts for shorter term trading. (See Figure 10.16.)
One way to combine daily and weekly stochastics is to use
weekly signals to determine market direction and daily signals for
timing. It's also a good idea to combine stochastics with RSI. (See
Figure 10.17.)
* The second smoothing produces 3 lines. Fast stochastics uses the first 2 lines.
Slow stochastics uses the last 2 lines.

line is less volatile and reaches extremes less frequently than stochastics. The
best signals occur when both oscillators are in overbought or oversold territory.

LARRY WILLIAMS %R
Larry Williams %R is based on a similar concept of measuring the
latest close in relation to its price range over a given number of days.
Today's close is subtracted from the price high of the range for a
given number of days and that difference is divided by the total range
for the same period. The concepts already discussed for oscillator
interpretation are applied to %R as well, with the main factors being
the presence of divergences in overbought or oversold areas. (See
Figure 10.18.) Since %R is subtracted from the high, it looks like an
upside down stochastics. To correct that, charting packages plot an
inverted version of %R.

Figure 10.18 Larry Williams %R oscillator is used in the same fashion as other

Choice of Time Period Tied to Cycles
Oscillator lengths can be tied to underlying market cycles. A time
period of V2 the cycle length is used. Popular time inputs are 5,10,
and 20 days based on calendar day periods of 14, 28, and 56 days.
Wilder's RSI uses 14 days, which is half of 28. In the previous
chapter, we discussed some reasons why the numbers 5, 10, and 20
keep cropping up in moving average and oscillator formulations, so
we won't repeat them here. Suffice it to mention here that 28 calendar
days (20 trading days) represent an important dominant monthly
trading cycle and that the other numbers are related harmonically to
that monthly cycle. The popularity of the 10 day momentum and the
14 day RSI lengths are based largely on the 28 day trading cycle and
measure V2 of the value of that dominant trading cycle. We'll come
back to the importance of cycles in Chapter 14.

THE IMPORTANCE OF TREND
In this chapter, we've discussed the use of the oscillator in market
analysis to help determine near term overbought and oversold
conditions, and to alert traders to possible divergences. We started
with the momentum line. We discussed another way to measure rates
of change (ROC) by using price ratios instead of differences. We then
showed how two moving averages could be compared to spot short
term extremes and crossovers. Finally, we looked at RSI and
Stochastics and considered how oscillators should be synchronized
with cycles.
Divergence analysis provides us with the oscillator's greatest
value. However, the reader is cautioned against placing too much
importance on divergence analysis to the point where basic trend
analysis is either ignored or overlooked. Most oscillator buy signals
work best in uptrends and oscillator sell signals are most profitable in
downtrends. The place to start your market analysis is always by
determining the general trend of the market. If the trend is up, then a
buying strategy is called for. Oscillators can then be used to help time
market entry. Buy when the market is oversold in an uptrend. Sell
short when the market is overbought in a downtrend. Or, buy when
the momentum oscillator crosses back above the zero line when the
major trend is bullish and sell a crossing under the zero line in a bear
market.
The importance of trading in the direction of the major trend
cannot be overstated. The danger in placing too much importance on
oscillators by themselves is the temptation to use divergence as an
excuse to initiate trades contrary to the general trend. This action
generally proves a costly and painful exercise. The oscillator, as
useful as it is, is just one tool among many others and must always be
used as an aid, not a substitute, for basic trend analysis.

WHEN OSCILLATORS ARE
MOST USEFUL
There are times when oscillators are more useful than at others.
During choppy market periods, as prices move sideways for several
weeks or months, oscillators track the price movement very close-

www.Fxborssa.com

252

Chapter 10

ly. The peaks and troughs on the price chart coincide almost exact-- ly
with the peaks and troughs on the oscillator. Because both price and
oscillator are moving sideways, they look very much alike. At some
point, however, a price breakout occurs and a new uptrend or downtrend
begins. By its very nature, the oscillator is already in an extreme
position just as the breakout is taking place. If the breakout is to the
upside, the oscillator is already overbought. An oversold reading
usually accompanies a downside breakout. The trader is faced with a
dilemma. Should he or she buy the bullish breakout in the face of an
overbought oscillator reading? Should the downside breakout be sold
into an oversold market?
In such cases, the oscillator is best ignored for the time being
and the position taken. The reason for this is that in the early stages
of a new trend, following an important breakout, oscillators often
reach extremes very quickly and stay there for awhile. Basic trend
analysis should be the main consideration at such times, with
oscillators given a lesser role. Later on, as the trend begins to mature,
the oscillator should be given greater weight. (We'll see in Chapter
13, that the fifth and final wave in Elliott Wave analysis is often
confirmed by bearish oscillator divergences.) Many dynamic bull
moves have been missed by traders who saw the major trend signal,
but decided to wait for their oscillators to move into an oversold
condition before buying. To summarize, give less attention to the
oscillator in the early stages of an important move, but pay close
attention to its signals as the move reaches maturity.

MOVING AVERAGE CONVERGENCE/
DIVERGENCE (MACD)
We mentioned in the previous chapter an oscillator technique that
uses 2 exponential moving averages and here it is. The Moving
Average Convergence/Divergence indicator, or simply MACD, was
developed by Gerald Appel. What makes this indicator so useful is
that it combines some of the oscillator principles we've already
explained with a dual moving average crossover approach. You'll see
only two lines on your computer screen although three lines are
actually used in its calculation. The faster

www.Fxborssa.com

253

Oscillators and Contrary Opinion

line (called the MACD line) is the difference between two exponentially smoothed moving averages of closing prices (usually the
last 12 and 26 days or weeks). The slower line (called the signal line)
is usually a 9 period exponentially smoothed average of the MACD
line. Appel originally recommended one set of numbers for buy
signals and another for sell signals. Most traders, however, utilize the
default values of 12, 26, and 9 in all instances. That would include
daily and weekly values. (See Figure 10.19a.)
The actual buy and sell signals are given when the two lines
cross. A crossing by the faster MACD line above the slower signal
line is a buy signal. A crossing by the faster line below the slower is a
sell signal. In that sense, MACD resembles a dual moving average
crossover method. However, the MACD values also fluctuate above
and below a zero line. That's where it begins to resemble an
oscillator. An overbought condition is present when

the lines are too far above the zero line. An oversold condition is
present when the lines are too far below the zero line. The best buy
signals are given when prices are well below the zero line (oversold).
Crossings above and below the zero line are another way to generate
buy and sell signals respectively, similar to the momentum technique
we discussed previously.
Divergences appear between the trend of the MACD lines and
the price line. A negative, or bearish, divergence exists when the
MACD lines are well above the zero line (overbought) and start to
weaken while prices continue to trend higher. That is often a warning
of a market top. A positive, or bullish, divergence exists when the
MACD lines are well below the zero line (oversold) and start to
move up ahead of the price line. That is often an early sign of a
market bottom. Simple trendlines can be drawn on the MACD lines
to help identify important trend changes. (See Figure 10.19b.)

Figure 10.19b The MACD lines fluctuate around a zero line, giving it the
quality of an oscillator. The best buy signals occur below the zero line. The
best sell signals come from above. Notice the negative divergence given in
October (see down arrow).

MACD HISTOGRAM
We showed you earlier in the chapter how a histogram could be
constructed that plots the difference between two moving average
lines. Using that same technique, the two MACD lines can be turned
into an MACD histogram. The histogram consists of vertical bars that
show the difference between the two MACD lines. The histogram has
a zero line of its own. When the MACD lines are in positive
alignment (faster line over the slower), the histogram is above its zero
line. Crossings by the histogram above and below its zero line
coincide with actual MACD crossover buy and sell signals.
The real value of the histogram is spotting when the spread
between the two lines is widening or narrowing. When the histogram
is over its zero line (positive) but starts to fall toward the zero line,
the uptrend is weakening. Conversely, when the histogram is below
its zero line (negative) and starts to move upward toward the zero
line, the downtrend is losing its momentum. Although no actual buy
or sell signal is given until the histogram crosses its zero line, the
histogram turns provide earlier warnings that the current trend is
losing momentum. Turns in the histogram back toward the zero line
always precede the actual crossover signals. Histogram turns are best
used for spotting early exit signals from existing positions. It's much
more dangerous to use the histogram turns as an excuse to initiate
new positions against the prevailing trend. (See Figure 10.20a.)

256

Chapter 10

Figure 10.20a The MACD histogram plots the difference between the two
MACD lines. Signals are given on the zero line crossings. Notice that the
histogram turns earlier than the crossover signals, giving the trader some
advanced warning.

COMBINE WEEKLIES
AND DAILIES
As with all technical indicators, signals on weekly charts are always
more important than those on daily charts. The best way to combine
them is to use weekly signals to determine market direction and the
daily signals to fine-tune entry and exit points. A daily signal is
followed only when it agrees with the weekly signal. Used in that
fashion, the weekly signals become trend filters for daily signals.
That prevents using daily signals to trade against the prevailing trend.
Two crossover systems in which this principle is especially true are
MACD and Stochastics. (See Figure 10.20b.)

Oscillators and Contrary Opinion

257

Figure 10.20b The MACD histogram works well on weekly charts. At
the middle peak, the histogram turned down 10 weeks before the sell signal
(down arrow). At the two upturns, the histogram turned up 2 and 4 weeks
before the buy signals (up arrows).

THE PRINCIPLE OF CONTRARY
OPINION IN FUTURES
Oscillator analysis is the study of market extremes. One of the most
widely followed theories in measuring those market extremes is the
principle of Contrary Opinion. At the beginning of the book, two
principal philosophies of market analysis were identified—
fundamental and technical analysis. Contrary Opinion, although it is
generally listed under the category of technical analysis, is more aptly
described as a form of psychological analysis. Contrary Opinion adds
the important third dimension to market analysis—the
psychological—by determining the degree of bullishness or
bearishness among participants in the various financial markets.

www.Fxborssa.com

258

Chapter 10

The principle of Contrary Opinion holds that when the vast
majority of people agree on anything, they are generally wrong. A
true contrarian, therefore, will first try to determine what the majority
are doing and then will act in the opposite direction.
Humphrey B. Neill, considered the dean of contrary thinking,
described his theories in a 1954 book entitled, The Art of Contrary
Thinking. Ten years later, in 1964, James H. Sibbet began to apply
Neill's principles to commodity futures trading by creating the
Market Vane advisory service, which includes the Bullish Consensus
numbers (Market Vane, P.O. Box 90490, Pasadena, CA 91109). Each
week a poll of market letters is taken to determine the degree of
bullishness or bearishness among commodity professionals. The
purpose of the poll is to quantify market sentiment into a set of
numbers that can be analyzed and used in the market forecasting
process. The rationale behind this approach is that most futures
traders are influenced to a great extent by market advisory services.
By monitoring the views of the professional market letters, therefore,
a reasonably accurate gauge of the attitudes of the trading public can
be obtained.
Another service that provides an indication of market sentiment is the "Consensus Index of Bullish Market Opinion," published by Consensus National Commodity Futures Weekly
(Consensus, Inc., 1735 McGee Street, Kansas City, MO 64108).
These numbers are published each Friday and use 75% as an overbought and 25% as an oversold measurement.
Interpreting Bullish Consensus Numbers
Most traders seem to employ a fairly simple method of analyzing
these weekly numbers. If the numbers are above 75%, the market is
considered to be overbought and means that a top may be near. A
reading below 25% is interpreted to warn of an oversold condition
and the increased likelihood that a market bottom is near.

www.Fxborssa.com

Oscillators and Contrary Opinion

259

Contrary Opinion Measures Remaining Buying
or Selling Power
Consider the case of an individual speculator. Assume that speculator
reads his or her favorite newsletter and becomes convinced that a
market is about to move substantially higher. The more bullish the
forecast, the more aggressively that trader will approach the market.
Once that individual speculator's funds are fully committed to that
particular market, however, he or she is overbought—meaning there
are no more funds to commit to the market.
Expanding this situation to include all market participants, if
80-90% of market traders are bullish on a market, it is assumed that
they have already taken their market positions. Who is left to buy and
push the market higher? This then is one of the keys to understanding
Contrary Opinion. If the overwhelming sentiment of market traders is
on one side of the market, there simply isn't enough buying or selling
pressure left to continue the present trend.
Contrary Opinion Measures Strong Versus Weak
Hands
A second feature of this philosophy is its ability to compare strong
versus weak hands. Futures trading is a zero sum game. For every
long there is also a short. If 80% of the traders are on the long side of
a market, then the remaining 20% (who are holding short positions)
must be well financed enough to absorb the longs held by the other
80%. The shorts, therefore, must be holding much larger positions
than the longs (in this case, 4 to 1).
This means further that the shorts must be well capitalized
and are considered to be strong hands. The 80%, who are holding
much smaller positions per trader, are considered to be weaker hands
who will be forced to liquidate those longs on any sudden turn in
prices.

www.Fxborssa.com

260

Chapter 10

Some Additional Features of the Bullish
Consensus Numbers
Let's consider a few additional points that should be kept in mind
when using these numbers. The norm or equilibrium point is at 55%.
This allows for a built-in bullish bias on the part of the general
public. The upper extreme is considered to be 90% and the lower
extreme, 20%. Here again, the numbers are shifted upward slightly to
allow for the bullish bias.
A contrarian position can usually be considered when the
bullish consensus numbers are above 90% or under 20%. Readings
over 75% or under 25% are also considered warning zones and
suggest that a turn may be near. However, it is generally advisable to
await a change in the trend of the numbers before taking action
against the trend. A change in the direction of the Bullish Consensus
numbers, especially if it occurs from one of the danger zones, should
be watched closely.
The Importance of Open Interest (Futures)
Open interest also plays a role in the use of Bullish Consensus numbers. In general, the higher the open interest figures are, the better the
chance that the contrarian positions will prove profitable. A contrarian position should not be taken, however, while open interest is still
increasing. A continued rise in open interest numbers increases the
odds that the present trend will continue. Wait for the open interest
numbers to begin to flatten out or to decline before taking action.
Study the Commitments of Traders Report to ensure that
hedgers hold less than 50% of the open interest. Contrary Opinion
works better when most of the open interest is held by speculators,
who are considered to be weaker hands. It is not advisable to trade
against large hedging interests.
Watch the Market's Reaction to
Fundamental News
Watch the market's reaction to fundamental news very closely. The

261

area is a clear warning that a turn may be near. The first adverse news
is usually enough to quickly push prices in the other direction.
Correspondingly, the failure of prices in an oversold area (under
25%) to react to bearish news can be taken as a warning that all the
bad news has been fully discounted in the current low price. Any
bullish news will push prices higher.

Combine Contrarian Opinion with Other
Technical Tools
As a general rule, trade in the same direction as the trend of the
consensus numbers until an extreme is reached, at which time the
numbers should be monitored for a sign of a change in trend. It goes
without saying that standard technical analytical tools can and should
also be employed to help identify market turns at these critical times.
The breaking of support or resistance levels, trendlines, or moving
averages can be utilized to help confirm that the trend is in fact
turning. Divergences on oscillator charts are especially useful when
the Bullish Consensus numbers are overbought or oversold.

INVESTOR SENTIMENT READINGS
Each weekend Barron's includes in its Market Laboratory section a
set of numbers under the heading "Investor Sentiment Readings." In
that space, four different investor polls are included to gauge the
degree of bullishness and bearishness in the stock market. The figures
are given for the latest week and the period two and three weeks back
for comparison purposes. Here's a random sample of what the latest
week's figures might look like. Remember that these numbers are
contrary indicators. Too much bullishness is bad. Too much
bearishness is good.

that are bearish, and those that are expecting a market correction.
Bullish readings over 55% warn of too much optimism and are
potentially negative for the market. Bullish readings below 35%
reflect too much pessimism and are considered positive for the
market. The correction figure represents advisers who are bullish but
expecting short term weakness.

moving averages. Those numbers can also be used in a contrary
fashion. Readings above 70% suggest an overbought stock market.
Readings below 30% suggest an oversold market. The 10 week
readings are useful for measuring short to intermediate market turns.
The 30 week numbers are more useful for measuring major market
turns. The actual signal of a potential change in trend takes place
when the numbers rise back above 30 or fall back below 70.

Point and Figure
Charting

INTRODUCTION
The first charting technique used by stock market traders before the
turn of the century was point and figure charting. The actual name
"point and figure" has been attributed to Victor deVilliers in his 1933
classic, The Point and Figure Method of Anticipating Stock Price
Movements. The technique has had various names over the years. In
the 1880s and 1890s, it was known as the "book method." This was
the name Charles Dow gave it in a July 20, 1901 editorial of The
Wall Street Journal.
Dow indicated that the book method had been used for about
15 years, giving it a starting date of 1886. The name "figure charts"
was used from the 1920s until 1933 when "point and figure" became
the accepted name for this technique of tracking market movement.
R.D. Wyckoff also published several works dealing with the point
and figure method in the early 1930s.

Chapter 17

The Wall Street Journal started publishing daily high, low,
and closing stock prices in 1896, which is the first reference to the
more commonly known bar chart. Therefore, it appears that the point
and figure method predates bar charting by at least 10 years.
We're going to approach point and figure charting in two
steps. We'll look at the original method that relies on intraday price
moves. Then we'll show you a simpler version of point and figure
charting that can be constructed by using only the high and low
prices for any market.

THE POINT AND FIGURE VERSUS
THE BAR CHART
Let's begin with some of the basic differences between point and
figure charting and bar charting and look at a couple of chart
examples.
The point and figure chart is a study of pure price movement.
That is to say, it does not take time into consideration while plotting
the price action. A bar chart, by contrast, combines both price and
time. Because of the way the bar chart is constructed, the vertical axis
is the price scale and the horizontal axis, a time scale. On a daily
chart, for example, each successive day's price action moves one
space or bar to the right. This happens even if prices saw little or no
change for that day. Something must always be placed in the next
space. On the point and figure chart, only the price changes are
recorded. If no price change occurs, the chart is left untouched.
During active market periods, a considerable amount of plotting may
be required. During quiet market conditions, little or no plotting will
be needed.
An important difference is the treatment of volume. Bar charts
record volume bars under the day's price action. Point and figure
charts ignore volume numbers, as a separate entity. This last phrase,
"as a separate entity," is an important one. Although the volume
numbers are not recorded on the point and figure chart, it does not
necessarily follow that volume, or trading activity, is totally lost. On
the contrary, since intraday point and figure charts record all price
change activity, the heavier or lighter volume is reflected in the
amount of price changes recorded on the

www.Fxborssa.com

Point and Figure Charting

267

chart. Because volume is one of the more important ingredients in
determining the potency of support and resistance levels, point and
figure charts become especially useful in determining at which price
levels most of the trading activity took place and, hence, where the
important support and resistance numbers are. Figure 11.1 compares a
bar chart and a point and figure chart covering the same time span. In
one sense, the charts look similar, but, in another sense, quite
different. The general price and trend picture is captured on both
charts, but the method of recording prices is different. Notice in
Figure 11.2 the alternating columns of x's and o's. The x columns
represent rising prices, while the o columns show declining prices.
Each time a column of x's moves one box above a previous column of
x's, an upside breakout occurs. (See arrows in Figure 11.2.)

and a point and figure chart (right) for the same time period. The point and
figure chart uses x columns for rising prices and o columns for declining prices.

Figure 11.2 A buy signal is given when one x column rises above the top
of a previous x column (see up arrows). A sell signal is given when a column
ofo's falls below a previous o column (see down arrows). Signals are more
precise on point and figure charts.

Correspondingly, when a column of o's declines one box
under a previous column of o's, a downside breakout occurs. Notice
how much more precise these breakouts are than those on the bar
chart. These breakouts can, of course, be used as buy and sell signals.
We'll have more to say on buy and sell signals a bit later. But the
charts demonstrate one of the advantages of the point and figure
chart, mainly the greater precision and ease in recognizing trend
signals.
Figures 11.3 and 11.4 reveal another major advantage of the
point and figure chart: flexibility. While all three of the p&f charts
cover the same price action, we can make them look very different to
serve different purposes. One way to change the p&f chart is to vary
the reversal criteria (let's say from a 3 box reversal to a 5 box
reversal). The larger the number of boxes required for a reversal, the

Figure 11.4 Reducing the box size to 3 points produces more signals.
This is better for shorter term trading. The last rally from 920 to 1060 produced 6 different buy signals. Protective sell stops can be placed under the
highest column ofo's (see S1-S5).

Chapter 11

less sensitive the chart becomes. The second way to vary the chart is
to change the box size . Figure 2 uses a box size of 5 points. Figure
11.3 changes the box size from 5 points to 10 points. The number of
columns has been reduced from 44 in the 5x3 chart in Figure 11.2 to
only 16 columns in Figure 11.3. By using the larger box size in
Figure 11.3, fewer signals are given. That allows the investor to concentrate on the major trend of a market by avoiding all the short term
sell signals that are eliminated from the less sensitive chart.
Figure 11.4 reduces the box size from 5 to 3. That increases
the sensitivity of the chart. Why would anyone want to do that?
Because it's better for shorter term trading. Compare the last rally
from 920 to 1060 in all three charts. The 10x3 chart (Figure 11.3)
shows the last column as a series of x's with no o columns. The 5x3
chart (Figure 11.2) shows the last upleg in 5 columns—3 x columns
and 2 o columns. The 3x3 chart (Figure 11.4) breaks the last upleg
into 11 columns—6 x columns and 5 o columns. By increasing the
number of corrections during the uptrend (by increasing the number
of o columns), more repeat buy signals are given either for later entry
or for adding to winning positions. It also allows the trader to raise
protective sell stops below the latest columns of o's. The bottom line
is that you can alter the look of the point and figure chart to adjust its
sensitivity to suit your own needs.

CONSTRUCTION OF THE INTRADAY POINT AND FIGURE CHART
We've already stated that the intraday chart was the original type used
by point and figure chartists. The technique was originally used to
track stock market movement. The intent was to capture and record
on paper each one point move of the stocks under consideration. It
was felt that accumulation (buying) and distribution (selling) could
be better detected in this manner. Only whole numbers were
employed. Each box was given a value of one point and each one
point move in either direction was recorded. Fractions were largely
ignored. When the technique was later adopted to commodity
markets, the value of the box had to be adjusted to fit each different
commodity market. Let's construct an intraday chart using some
actual price data.

The following numbers describe 9 actual days of trading in a

every 5 point swing in either direction is plotted. We'll start with a 1

Figure 11.5a is what the previously listed numbers would look
like on the chart. Let's begin on the left side of the chart. First the
chart is scaled to reflect a 5 point increment for every box.
Column 1: Put a dot at 4875. Because the next number— 4880—is
higher, fill in the next box up to 4880.
Column 2: The next number is 4860. Move 1 column to the right, go
down 1 box, and fill in all the o's down to 4860.
Column 3: The next number is 4865. Move 1 column to the right,
move up 1 box and put an x at 4865. Stop here. So far
you have only 1 x marked in column 3 because prices
have only moved up 1 box. On a 1 box reversal chart,
there must always be at least 2 boxes filled in each
column. Notice that the next number is 4850, calling for
o's down to that number. Do you go to the next column
to record the column of declining o's? The answer is no
because that would leave only 1 mark, the x, in column
3. Therefore, in the column with the lone x (column 3)
fill in o's down to 4850.

Figure 11.5a A 5x1 point and figure chart of a Deutsche mark contract is
shown in the upper chart. The blackened boxes show the end of each day's
trading. Figure 11.5b shows the same price data with a 3 box reversal. Notice
the compression. Figure 11.5c shows a 5 box reversal.

Column 4: The next number is 4860. Move to the next column, move
1 box up, and plot in the x's up to 4860.
Column 5: The next number is 4855. Because this is a move down,
go to the next column, move down a box, and fill the o
at 4860. Notice on the table that this is the last price of
the day. Let's do one more.
Column 6: The first number on 5/2 is 4870. So far, you only have
one o in column 5. You must have at least 2 marks in
each column. Therefore, fill in x's (because prices are
advancing) up to 4870. But notice that the last price on
the previous day is blacked out. This is to help keep
track of time. By blacking in the last price each day, it's
much easier to keep track of the separate days' trading.
Feel free to continue through the remainder of the chart to
sharpen your understanding of the plotting process. Notice that

www.Fxborssa.com

273

Point and Figure Charting

this chart has several columns where both x's and o's are present. This
situation will only develop on the 1 point reversal chart and is caused
by the necessity of having at least 2 boxes filled in each column.
Some purists might argue with combining the x's and o's. Experience
will show, however, that this method of plotting prices makes it much
easier to follow the order of the transactions.
Figure 11.5b takes the same data from Figure 11.5a and transforms it into a 3 box reversal chart. Notice that the chart is condensed
and a lot of data is lost. Figure 11.5c shows a 5 box reversal. These
are the 3 reversal criteria that have traditionally been used— the 1, 3,
and 5 box reversal. The 1 box reversal is generally used for very short
term activity and the 3 box for the study of the intermediate trend.
The 5 box reversal, because of its severe condensation, is generally
used for the study of long term trends. The correct order to use is the
one shown here, that is, begin with the 1 point reversal chart. The 3
and 5 box reversals can then be constructed right off the first chart.
For obvious reasons, a 1 point reversal chart could not possibly be
constructed from a 3 or 5 box reversal.

Chapter 11

THE HORIZONTAL COUNT
One principal advantage of the intraday 1 box reversal chart is the
ability to obtain price objectives through use of the horizontal count.
If you think back to our coverage of bar charts and price patterns, the
question of price objectives was discussed. However, virtually all
methods of obtaining price objectives off bar charts were based on
what we call vertical measurements. This meant measuring the height
of a pattern (the volatility) and projecting that distance upward or
downward. For example, the head and shoulders pattern measured the
distance from the head to the neckline and swung that objective from
the break of that neckline.
Point and Figure Charts Allow
Horizontal Measurement
The principle of the horizontal count is based on the premise that
there is a direct relationship between the width of a congestion area
and the subsequent move once a breakout occurs. If the congestion
area represents a basing pattern, some estimate can be made of the
upside potential once the base is completed. Once the uptrend has
begun, subsequent congestion areas can be used to obtain additional
counts which can be utilized to confirm the original counts from the
base. (See Figure 11.6.)
The intent is to measure the width of the pattern. Remember
we're talking here of intraday 1 box reversal charts. The technique
requires some modifications for other types of charts that we'll come
back to later. Once a topping or basing area has been identified,
simply count the number of columns in that top or base. If there are
20 columns, for example, the upside or downside target would be 20
boxes from the measuring point. The key is to determine which line
to measure from. Sometimes this is easy and, at other times, more
difficult.
Usually, the horizontal line to count across is near the middle
of the congestion area. A more precise rule is to use the line that has
the least number of empty boxes in it. Or put the other way, the line
with the most number of filled in x's and o's. Once you find the
correct line to count across, it's important that you include every
column in your count, even the ones that are

congestion area, price objectives can be determined. The wider the congestion
area, the greater the objective.

empty. Count the number of columns in the congestion area and then
project that number up or down from the line that was used for the
count.

PRICE PATTERNS
Pattern identification is also possible on point and figure charts. Figure
11.7 shows the most common types.
As you can see, they're not much different from ones already
discussed on bar charting. Most of the patterns are variations on the
double and triple tops and bottoms, head and shoulders, V's and
inverted V's, and saucers. The term "fulcrum" shows up quite a bit in
the point and figure literature. Essentially, the fulcrum is a well
defined congestion area, occurring after a significant advance or
decline, that forms an accumulation base or a distribution top. In a
base, for example, the bottom of the area is subjected to repeated
tests, interrupted by intermittent rally attempts. Very often, the
fulcrum takes on the appearance of a double or triple bottom. The
basing pattern is completed when a breakout (catapult) occurs over
the top of the congestion area.

Those reversal patterns with the most pronounced horizontal
ranges obviously lend themselves quite well to the taking of count
measurements. The V base, in contrast, because of the absence of a
significant horizontal price area, would not be amenable to the taking
of a horizontal count. The blackened boxes in the chart examples in
Figure 11.7 represent suggested buying and selling points. Notice that
those entry points generally coincide with the retesting of support
areas in a base or resistance areas in a top, breakout points, and the
breaking of trendlines.
Trend Analysis and Trendlines
The price patterns in Figure 11.7 show trendlines drawn as part of
those patterns. Trendline analysis on intraday charts is the same as
that applied to bar charts. Up trendlines are drawn under successive
lows and down trendlines are drawn over successive peaks. This is
not true of the simplified point and figure chart, which we're going to
study next. It utilizes 45 degree lines and plots them differently.

3 BOX REVERSAL POINT AND
FIGURE CHARTING
In 1947, a book on point and figure was written by A.W. Cohen
entitled, Stock Market Timing. The following year, when the
Chartcraft Weekly Service was started, the book's name was changed
to The Chartcraft Method of Point & Figure Trading. Several revised
editions have been published since then to include commodities and
options. In 1990, Michael Burke wrote The All New Guide to the
Three-Point Reversal Method of Point & Figure Construction and
Formations (Chartcraft, New Rochelle, NY).
The original 1 box reversal method of plotting markets
required intraday prices. The 3 box reversal was a condensation of
the 1 box and was meant for intermediate trend analysis. Cohen
reasoned that because so few 3 box reversals occurred in stocks
during the day that it was not necessary to use intraday prices to

www.Fxborssa.com

278

Chapter 11

construct the 3 box reversal chart. Hence the decision to use only the
high and low prices, which were readily available in most financial
newspapers. This modified technique, which is the basis of the
Chartcraft service, greatly simplified point and figure charting and
made it accessible to the average trader.

CONSTRUCTION OF THE 3 POINT
REVERSAL CHART
The construction of the chart is relatively simple. First, the chart
must be scaled in the same way as the intraday chart. A value must
be assigned to each box. These tasks are performed for subscribers to
the Chartcraft service because the charts are already constructed and
the box values assigned. The chart shows a series of alternating
columns with x's representing rising prices and the o columns
showing falling prices. (See Figure 11.8.)
The actual plotting of the x's and o's requires only the high
and low prices for the day. If the last column is an x column
(showing rising prices), then look at the high price for the day. If the
daily high permits the filling in of 1 or more x's, then fill in those
boxes and stop. That's all you do for that day. Remember that the
entire value of the box must be filled. Fractions or partial filling of
the box don't count. Repeat the same process the next day, looking
only at the high price. As long as prices continue to rise, permitting
the plotting of at least one x, continue to fill in the boxes with x's,
ignoring the low price.
The day finally comes when the daily high price is not high
enough to fill the next x box. At that point, look at the low price to
determine if a 3 box reversal has occurred in the other direction. If
so, move one column to the right, move down one box, and fill the
next 3 boxes with o's to signify a new down column. Because you are
now in a down column, the next day consult the low price to see if
that column of o's can be continued. If one or more o's can be filled
in, then do so. Only when the daily low does not permit the filling in
of any more o's do you look at the daily high to see if a 3 box reversal
has occurred to the upside. If so, move 1 column to the right and
begin a new x column.

Chart Patterns
Figure 11.9 shows 16 price patterns most common to this type of
point and figure chart—8 buy signals and 8 sell signals.
Let's take a look at the patterns. Since column 2, showing
signals S-l through S-8, is just a mirror image of column 1, we'll
concentrate on the buy side. The first 2 signals, B-l and B-2, are
simple formations. All that is required for the simple bullish buy
signal is 3 columns, with the second column of x's moving 1 box
above the previous column of x's. B-2 is similar to B-l with one
minor difference—there are now 4 columns, with the bottom of the
second column of o's higher than the first. B-l shows a simple
breakout through resistance. B-2 shows the same bullish breakout but
with the added bullish feature of rising bottoms. B-2 is a slightly
stronger pattern than B-l for that reason.
The third pattern (B-3), breakout of a triple top, begins the
complex formations. Notice that the simple bullish buy signal is a
part of each complex formation. Also, as we move down the page,
these formations become increasingly stronger. The triple top
breakout is stronger because there are 5 columns involved and 2
columns of x's have been penetrated. Remember that the wider the
base, the greater the upside potential. The next pattern (B-4),
ascending triple top, is stronger than B-3 because the tops and
bottoms are both ascending. The spread triple top (B-5) is even
stronger because there are 7 columns involved, and 3 columns of x's
are exceeded.
The upside breakout above a bullish triangle (B-6) combines
two signals. First, a simple buy signal must be present. Then the
upper trendline must be cleared. (We'll cover the drawing of
trendlines on these charts in the next section). Signal B-7, upside
breakout above a bullish resistance line, is self-explanatory. Again,
two things must be present. A buy signal must have already been
given; and the upper channel line must be completely cleared. The
final pattern, the upside breakout above a bearish resistance line (B8), also requires two elements. A simple buy signal must be
combined with a clearing of the down trendline. Of course, everything we've said regarding patterns B-l through B-8 applies equally to
patterns S-l through S-8 except that, in the latter case, prices are
headed down instead of up.

Chapter 11

There is a difference between how these patterns are applied to
commodity markets as opposed to common stocks. In general, all 16
signals can be used in stock market trading. However, because of the
rapid movement so characteristic of the futures markets, the complex
patterns are not as common in the commodity markets. Much greater
emphasis is therefore placed on the simple signals. Many futures
traders utilize the simple signals alone. If the trader chooses to wait
for the more complex and stronger patterns, many profitable trading
opportunities will be missed.

THE DRAWING OF TRENDLINES
In our discussion of intraday charts, it was pointed out that trendlines were drawn in the conventional way. This is not the case on
these 3 point reversal charts. Trendlines on these charts are drawn at
45 degree angles. Also, trendlines do not necessarily have to connect
previous tops or bottoms.
The Basic Bullish Support Line and Bearish
Resistance Line
These are your basic up and down trendlines. Because of the severe
condensation on these charts, it would be impractical to try to
connect rally tops or reaction lows. The 45 degree line is, therefore,
used. In an uptrend, the bullish support line is drawn at a 45 degree
angle upward to the right from under the lowest column of o's. As
long as prices remain above that line, the major trend is considered to
be bullish. In a downtrend, the bearish resistance line is drawn at a 45
degree angle downward to the right from the top of the highest
column of x's. As long as prices remain below that down trendline,
the trend is bearish. (See Figures 11.10-11.12.)
At times, those lines may have to be adjusted. For example,
sometimes a correction in an uptrend breaks below the rising support
line after which the uptrend resumes. In such cases, a new support
line must be drawn at a 45 degree angle from the bottom of that
reaction low. Sometimes a trend is so strong that the orig-

inal up trendline is simply too far away from the price action. In that
case, a tighter trendline should be drawn in an attempt to arrive at a
"best fitting" support line.

MEASURING TECHNIQUES
Three point reversal charts allow the use of two different measuring
techniques—the horizontal and the vertical. For the horizontal, count
the number of columns in a bottom or topping pattern. That number
of columns must then be multiplied by the value of the reversal or the
number of boxes needed for a reversal. For example, let's assign a
$1.00 box value to a chart with a 3 box reversal. We count the
number of boxes across a base and come up with 10. Because we're
using a 3 box reversal, the value of that reversal is $3.00 (3x$1.00).
Multiply the 10 columns across the base by $3 for a total of $30. That
number is then added to the bottom of the basing pattern or
subtracted from the top of a topping pattern to arrive at the price
objective.
The vertical count is a bit simpler. Measure the number of
boxes in the first column of the new trend. In an uptrend, measure the
first up column of x's. In a downtrend, measure the first down column
of o's. Multiply that value by 3 and add that total to the bottom or
subtract it from the top of the column. What you're doing in effect
with a 3 box reversal chart is tripling the size of the first leg. If a
double top or bottom occurs on the chart, use the second column of
o's or x's for the vertical count. (See Figure 11.12.)

TRADING TACTICS
Let's look at the various ways that these point and figure charts can
be used to determine specific entry and exit points.
1. A simple buy signal can be used for the covering of old shorts
and/or the initiation of new longs.
2. A simple sell signal can be used for the liquidation of old
longs and/or the initiation of new shorts.

www.Fxborssa.com

Point and Figure Charting

287

3. The simple signal can be used only for liquidation purposes
with a complex formation needed for a new commitment.
4. The trendline can be used as a filter. Long positions are taken
above the trendline and short positions below the trendline.
5. For stop protection, always risk below the last column of o's in
an uptrend and over the last column of x's in a downtrend.
6. The actual entry point can be varied as follows:
a. Buy the actual breakout in an uptrend.
b. Buy a 3 box reversal after the breakout occurs to obtain
a lower entry point.
c. Buy a 3 box reversal in the direction of the original
breakout after a correction occurs. Not only does this
require the added confirmation of a positive reversal in
the right direction, but a closer stop point can now be
used under the latest column of o's.
d. Buy a second breakout in the same direction as the orig
inal breakout signal.
As you can readily see from the list, there are many different
ways that the point and figure chart can be used. Once the basic
technique is understood, there is almost unlimited flexibility as to
how to best enter and exit a market using this approach.
Adjusting Stops
The actual buy or sell signal occurs on the first signal. However, as
the move continues, several other signals appear on the chart. These
repeat buy or sell signals can be used for additional positions.
Whether or not this is done, the protective stop point can be raised to
just below the latest o column in an uptrend and lowered to just over
the latest x column in a downtrend. This use of a trailing stop allows
the trader to stay with the position and protect accumulated profits at
the same time.

Chapter 17

What to Do After a Prolonged Move
Intermittent corrections against the trend allow the trader to adjust
stops once the trend has resumed. How is this accomplished,
however, if no 3 box reversals occur during the trend? The trader is
then faced with a long column of x's in an uptrend or o's in a
downtrend. This type of market situation creates what is called a
pole, that is, a long column of x's and o's without a correction. The
trader wants to stay with the trend but also wants some technique to
protect profits. There is at least one way to accomplish this. After an
uninterrupted move of 10 or more boxes, place a protective stop at
the point where a 3 box reversal would occur. If the position does get
stopped out, reentry can be done on another 3 box reversal in the
direction of the original trend. In that case, an added advantage is the
placement of the new stop under the most recent column of o's in an
uptrend or over the latest column of x's in a downtrend.

ADVANTAGES OF POINT AND
FIGURE CHARTS
Let's briefly recap some of the advantages of point and figure
charting.
1. By varying the box and reversal sizes, these charts can be
adapted to almost any need. There are also many different
ways these charts can be used for entry and exit points.
2. Trading signals are more precise on point and figure charts
than on bar charts.
3. By following these specific point and figure signals, better
trading discipline can be achieved. (See Figures 11.13-11.18.)

P&F TECHNICAL INDICATORS
In his 1995 book, Point & Figure Charting (John Wiley & Sons),
Thomas J. Dorsey espouses the Chartcraft method of 3 point reversal
charting of stocks. He also discusses point and figure application to
commodity and options trading. In addition to explaining how to
construct and read the charts, Dorsey also shows how the P&F
technique can be applied to relative strength analysis, sector analysis,
and in the construction of an NYSE Bullish Percent Index. He shows
how p&f charts can be constructed for the NYSE advance decline
line, the NYSE High-Low Index, and the percentage of stocks over
their 10 and 30 week averages. Dorsey credits Michael Burke, the
publisher of Chartcraft, (Chartcraft, Inc., Investors Intelligence, 30
Church Street, New Rochelle, N.Y. 10801) with the actual
development of these innovative p&f indicators which are available
in that chart service.

COMPUTERIZED P&F CHARTING
Computers have taken the drudgery out of point and figure charting.
The days of laboriously constructing columns of x's and o's are gone.
Most charting software packages do the charting for you. In addition,
you can vary the box and reversal sizes with a keystroke to adjust the
chart for shorter or longer term analysis. You can construct p&f
charts from real-time (intraday) and end of day data, and you can
apply them to any market you want. But you can do a lot more with a
computer.
Kenneth Tower (CMT), technical analyst for UST Securities
Corporation, (5 Vaughn Drive, CN5209, Princeton, N.J. 08543) uses
a logarithmic method of point and figure charting. A screening
process that measures the volatility of a stock over the last 3 years
determines the right percentage box size for each stock. Figures
11.19 and 11.20 show examples of Tower's logarithmic p&f charts
applied to America Online and Intel. The box size for AOL in Figure
11.19 is 3.6%. A 1 box reversal, therefore, would require a retracement of 3.6%. Since that happens to be a 2 box reversal chart, prices
would have to retrace 7.2% to start a new column. Each box size for
the Intel chart shown in Figure 11.20 is worth 3.2%.

Chapter 11

The arcs you see on both charts are examples of using horizontal price counts across a price base to arrive at short and long
term price objectives. The Intel chart, for example, shows a short
term objective to 33, arrived at by measuring halfway across the price
base (lower arc). The larger arc, which measures to 87.6, is arrived at
by measuring across the entire price base and projecting that distance
upward. If you look closely at Figures 11.19 and 11.20, you'll also
see price dots trailing the price action. Those dots happen to be
moving averages.

P&F MOVING AVERAGES
Moving averages are usually applied to bar charts. But here they are
on point & figure charts, courtesy of Ken Tower and UST Securities.
Tower uses two moving averages on his charts, a 10 column and a 20
column moving average. The dots you see in Figures 11.19 and 11.20
are 10 column averages. These moving averages are constructed by
first finding an average price for each column. That is done by
simply adding up the prices in each column and dividing the total by
the number of x's or o's in that column. The resulting numbers are
then averaged over 10 and 20 columns. The moving averages are
used in the same way as on bar charts.
Figure 11.21 shows two point and figure charts of the same
stock with 10 column averages (dots) and 20 column averages
(dashes). The bottom chart is a 2.7% reversal logarithmic chart of
Royal Dutch Petroleum going back to 1992. Notice that the faster
moving average stayed above the slower moving average from 1993
to the 1997 during the four year uptrend. You can see the two moving
averages coming together during the second half of 1997 in what
turned out to be a consolidation year for that stock. To the far right,
you can see that Royal Dutch may be on the verge of resuming its
major uptrend. A closer look at that potential upside breakout is seen
in the upper chart in Figure 11.21.
The upper chart is a traditional one point reversal linear chart
of the same stock. The time frame covered in the linear chart is much
shorter than the long chart. But you get a closer look at the late 1997
and early 1998 price action and can see the

short term upside breakout at the start of 1998. The stock still needs
to close through 60 to confirm a major bullish breakout. The moving
averages haven't been much help during the trading range (they never
are), but should begin to trend higher once again if the bullish
breakout materializes. By adding moving averages to point and figure
charts, Ken Tower brings another valuable technical indicator to p&f
charting. The use of logarithmic charts also adds a modern wrinkle to
this old charting method.

CONCLUSION
Point and figure charting isn't the oldest technique in the world. That
credit goes to the Japanese candlestick chart, which has been used in
that country for centuries. In the next chapter Greg Morris, author of
two books on candlesticks, will introduce that ancient technique that
has gained new popularity in recent years among Western technical
analysts.

INTRODUCTION
While the Japanese have used this charting and analysis technique for centuries, only in recent years has it become popular in
the West. The term, candlesticks, actually refers to two different,
but related subjects. First, and possibly the more popular, is the
method of displaying stock and futures data for chart analysis.
Secondly, it is the art of identifying certain combinations of candlesticks in defined and proven combinations. Fortunately, both
techniques can be used independently or in combination.

CANDLESTICK CHARTING
Charting market data in candlestick form uses the same data
available for standard bar charts; open, high, low, and close prices.
While using the exact same data, candlestick charts offer a much

more visually appealing chart. Information seems to jump off the
page (computer screen). The information displayed is more easily
interpreted and analyzed. The box below is a depiction of of a single
day of prices showing the difference between the bar (left) and the
candlestick(s). (See Figure 12.1.)

Figure 12.1
You can see how the name "candlesticks" came about. They
look somewhat like a candle with a wick. The rectangle represents
the difference between the open and close price for the day, and is
called the body. Notice that the body can be either black or white. A
white body means that the close price was greater (higher) than the
open price. Actually, the body is not white, but open (not filled),
which makes it work better with computers. This is so that it will
print correctly when printing charts on a computer. This is one of the
adaptations that have occurred in the West; the Japanese use red for
the open body. The black body means that the close price was lower
than the open price. The open and close prices are given much
significance in Japanese candlesticks. The small lines above and
below the body are referred to as wicks or hairs or shadows. Many
different names for these lines appear in Japanese reference literature,
which is odd since they represent the high and low prices for the day
and are normally not considered vital in the analysis by the Japanese.
(See Figure 12.2.)
Figure 12.2 shows the same data in both the popular bar chart
and in a Japanese candlestick format. You can quickly see that
information not readily available on the bar chart seems to jump from
the page (screen) on the candlestick chart. Initially, it takes some
getting use to, but after a while you may prefer it.

The different shapes for candlesticks have different meanings.
The Japanese have defined different primary candlesticks, based
upon the relationship of open, high, low, and close prices.
Understanding these basic candlesticks is the beginning of candlestick analysis.

BASIC CANDLESTICKS
Different body/shadow combinations have different meanings. Days
in which the difference between the open and close prices is great are
called Long Days. Likewise, days in which the difference between
the open and close price is small, are called Short Days. Remember,
we are only talking about the size of the body and no reference is
made to trie high and/or low prices. (See Figure 12.3.) Spinning Tops
are days in which the candlesticks have small bodies with upper and
lower shadows that are of greater length

than that of the body. The body color is relatively unimportant in
spinning top candlesticks. These candlesticks are considered as days
of indecision. (See Figure 12.4.)
When the open price and the close price are equal, they are
called Doji lines. Doji candlesticks can have shadows of varying
length. When referring to Doji candlesticks, there is some consideration as to whether the open and close price must be exactly equal.
This is a time when the prices must be almost equal, especially when
dealing with large price movements.
There are different Doji candlesticks that are important. The
Long-legged Doji has long upper and lower shadows and reflects
considerable indecision on the part of market participants. The
Gravestone Doji has only a long upper shadow and no lower shadow.
The longer the upper shadow, the more bearish the interpretation.
Figure 12.5 Doji candlesticks.

www.Fxborssa.com

Japanese Candlesticks

301

The Dragonfly Doji is the opposite of the Gravestone Doji, the
lower shadow is long and there is no upper shadow. It is usually
considered quite bullish. (See Figure 12.5.)
The single candlestick lines are essential to Japanese candlestick analysis. You will find that all Japanese candle patterns
are made from combinations of these basic candlesticks.

CANDLE PATTERN ANALYSIS
A Japanese candle pattern is a psychological depiction of traders'
mentality at the time. It vividly shows the actions of the traders as
time unfolds in the market. The mere fact that humans react consistently during similar situations makes candle pattern analysis work.
A Japanese candle pattern can consist of a single candlestick line or
be a combination of multiple lines, normally never more than
five. While most candle patterns are used to determine reversal
points in the market, there are a few that are used to determine
trend continuation. They are referred to as reversal and continuation patterns. Whenever a reversal pattern has bullish implications, an inversely related pattern has bearish meaning. Similarly,
whenever a continuation pattern has bullish implications, an
opposite pattern gives bearish meaning. When there is a pair of
patterns that work in both bullish and bearish situations, they usually have the same name. In a few cases, however, the bullish pattern and its bearish counterpart have completely different names.
Reversal Patterns
A reversal candle pattern is a combination of Japanese candlesticks
that normally indicate a reversal of the trend. One serious consideration that must be used to help identify patterns as being
either bullish or bearish is the trend of the market preceding the
pattern. You cannot have a bullish reversal pattern in an uptrend.
You can have a series of candlesticks that resemble the bullish pattern, but if the trend is up, it is not a bullish Japanese candle pattern. Likewise, you cannot have a bearish reversal candle pattern
in a downtrend.

www.Fxborssa.com

302

Chapter 12

This presents one of the age-old problems when analyzing
markets: What is the trend? You must determine the trend, before you
can utilize Japanese candle patterns effectively. While volumes have
been written on the subject of trend determination, the use of a
moving average will work quite well with Japanese candle patterns.
Once the short term (ten periods or so) trend has been determined,
Japanese candle patterns will significantly assist in identifying the
reversal of that trend.
Japanese literature consistently refers to approximately forty
reversal candle patterns. These vary from single candlestick lines to
more complex patterns of up to five candlestick lines. There are many
good references on candlesticks, so only a few of the more popular
patterns will be discussed here.
-------- Dark Cloud Cover. This is a two day
reversal pattern that only has bearish implications. (See Figure
12.6.) This is also one of the times when the pattern's
counterpart exists but has a different name (see Piercing
Line). The first day of this pattern is a long white
candlestick. This reflects the current trend of the market
and helps confirm the uptrend to traders. The next day
opens above the high price of the previous day, again
adding to the bullishness. However,

close price at least below the midpoint of the body of the first day. This is a significant blow to the
bullish mentality and will force many to exit the market. Since the
close price is below the open price on the second day, the body is
black. This is the dark cloud referred to in the name.

(

Piercing Line. The opposite of the Dark Cloud Cover, the Piercing
Line, has bullish implications. (See Figure 12.7.) The scenario is
quite similar, but opposite. A downtrend is in place, the

first candlestick is a long black day which
solidifies traders' confidence in the

The Evening Star and its cousin, the
Morning Star, are two powerful reversal
candle patterns. These are both three day
patterns that work exceptionally well. The scenario for understanding
Figure 12.7 Piercing line +. the change in trader psychology for the
Evening Star will be thoroughly discussed
here since the opposite can be said for the Morning Star. (See Figures
12.8 and 12.9.)

Figure 12.8 Evening star -.

www.Fxborssa.com

Figure 12.9 Morning star +.

304

Chapter 12

The Evening Star is a bearish reversal candle pattern, as its
name suggests. The first day of this pattern is a long white candlestick which fully enforces the current uptrend. On the open of the
second day, prices gap up above the body of the first day. Trading on
this second day is somewhat restricted and the close price is near the
open price while remaining above the body of the first day. The body
for the second day is small. This type of day following a long day is
referred to as a Star pattern. A Star is a small body day that gaps
away from a long body day. The third and last day of this pattern
opens with a gap below the body of the star and closes lower with the
close price below the midpoint of the first day.
The previous explanation was the perfect scenario. Many
references will accept as valid, an Evening Star which does not meet
each detail exactly. For instance, the third day might not gap down or
the close on the third day might not be quite below the midpoint of
the first day's body. These details are subjective when viewing a
candlestick chart, but not when using a computer program to
automatically identify the patterns. That is because computer
programs require explicit instructions to read the candle chart, and
don't allow for subjective interpretation.
Continuation Patterns
Each trading day, a decision needs to be made, whether it is to exit a
trade, enter a trade, or remain in a trade. A candle pattern that helps
identify the fact that the current trend is going to continue is more
valuable than may first appear. It helps answer the question as to
whether or not you should remain in a trade. Japanese literature
refers to 16 continuation candle patterns. One continuation pattern
and its related opposite cousin are particularly good at trend
continuation identification.
Rising and Falling Three Methods, The Rising Three Methods continuation candle pattern is the bullish counterpart to this duo and will
be the subject of this scenario building. A bullish continuation pattern
can only occur in an uptrend and a bearish continuation pattern can
only occur in a downtrend. This restates the required relationship to
the trend that is so necessary in candle pattern analysis. (See Figures
12.10 and 12.11.)

www.Fxborssa.com

305

Japanese Candlesticks

Figure 12.10 Rising Three
Methods +.

Figure 12.11 Falling Three
Methods -.

The first day of the Rising Three Methods pattern is a long
white day which fully supports the uptrending market. However, over
the course of the next three trading periods, small body days occur
which, as a group, trend downward. They all remain within the range
of the first day's long white body and at least two of these three
small-bodied days have black bodies. This period of time when the
market appears to have gone nowhere is considered by the Japanese
as a "period of rest." On the fifth day of this pattern, another long
white day develops which closes at a new high. Prices have finally
broken out of the short trading range and the uptrend will continue.
A five day pattern such as the Rising Three Methods requires
a lot of detail in its definition. The above scenario is the perfect
example of the Rising Three Methods pattern. Flexibility can be
applied with some success and this only comes with experience. For
example, the three small reaction days could remain within the first
day's high-low range instead of the body's range. The small reaction
days do not always have to be predominantly black. And finally, the
concept of the "period of rest" could be expanded to include more
than three reaction days. Don't ignore the Rising and Falling Three
Methods pattern; it can give you a feeling of comfort when worrying
about protecting profits in a trade.

Using Computers for Candle
Pattern Identification
A personal computer with software designed to recognize candle
patterns is a great way to remove emotion, especially during a trade.
However, there are a couple of things to keep in mind when viewing
candlesticks on a computer screen. A computer screen is made up of
small light elements called pixels. There are only so many pixels on
your computer screen, with the amount based upon the resolution of
your video card/monitor combination. If you are viewing price data
that has a large range of prices in a short period of time, you may
think that you are seeing many Doji days (open and close price are
equal) when in fact, you are not. With a large range of prices on the
screen, each pixel element will have a price range of its own. A
computer software program that identifies patterns based on a
mathematical relationship will overcome this visual anomaly.
Hopefully, the above explanation will keep you from thinking that
your software isn't working.

FILTERED CANDLE PATTERNS
A revolutionary concept developed by Greg Morris in 1991, called
candle pattern filtering, provides a simple method to improve the
overall reliability of candle patterns. While the short term trend of the
market must be identified before a candle pattern can exist,
determination of overbought and oversold markets using traditional
technical analysis will enhance a candle pattern's predictive ability.
Concurrently, this technique helps eliminate bad or premature candle
patterns.
One must first grasp how a traditional technical indicator
responds to price data. In this example, Stochastics %D will be used.
The stochastic indicator oscillates between 0 and 100, with 20 being
oversold and 80 being overbought. The primary interpretation for this
indicator is when %D rises above 80 and then falls below 80, a sell
signal has been generated. Similarly, when it drops below 20 and
then rises above 20, a buy signal is given. (See Chapter 10 for more
on Stochastics.)

www.Fxborssa.com

Japanese Candlesticks

307

Here is what we know about stochastics %D: When it enters
the area above 80 or below 20, it will eventually generate a signal. In
other words, it is just a matter of time until a signal is given. The area
above 80 and below 20 is called the presignal area and represents the
area that %D must get to before it can give a trading signal of its
own. (See Figure 12.12.)

Figure 12.12
The filtered candle pattern concept uses this presignal area.
Candle patterns are considered only when %D is in its presignal area.
If a candle pattern occurs when stochastics %D is at, say 65, the
pattern is ignored. Also, only reversal candle patterns are considered
using this concept.
Candle pattern filtering is not limited to using stochastics %D.
Any technical oscillator that you might normally use for analysis can
be used to filter candle patterns. Wilder's RSI, Lambert's CCI, and
Williams' %R are a few that will work equally as well. (These
oscillators are explained in Chapter 10.)

CONCLUSION
Japanese candlestick charting and candle pattern analysis are
essential tools for making market timing decisions. One should use
Japanese candle patterns in the same manner as any other technical
tool or technique; that is, to study the psychology of market
participants. Once you become used to seeing your price charts using
candlesticks, you may not want to use bar charts again. Japanese
candle patterns, used in conjunction with other technical indicators in
the filtering concept, will almost always offer a trading signal prior to
using other price-based indicators.

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
In 1938, a monograph entitled The Wave Principle was the first
published reference to what has come to be known as the Elliott
Wave Principle. The monograph was published by Charles J. Collins
and was based on the original work presented to him by the founder
of the Wave Principle, Ralph Nelson (R.N.) Elliott.
Elliott was very much influenced by the Dow Theory, which
has much in common with the Wave Principle. In a 1934 letter to
Collins, Elliott mentioned that he had been a subscriber to Robert
Rhea's stock market service and was familiar with Rhea's book on
Dow Theory. Elliott goes on to say that the Wave Principle was "a
much needed complement to the Dow Theory."
In 1946, just two years before his death, Elliott wrote his
definitive work on the Wave Principle, Nature's Law—The Secret of
the Universe.
Elliott's ideas might have faded from memory if A. Hamilton
Bolton hadn't decided in 1953 to publish the Elliott Wave Supplement
to the Bank Credit Analyst, which he did annual-

ly for 14 years, until his death in 1967. A.J. Frost took over the Elliott
Supplements and collaborated with Robert Prechter in 1978 on the
Elliott Wave Principle. Most of the diagrams in this chapter are taken
from Frost and Prechter's book. Prechter went a step further and in
1980 published The Major Works of R.N. Elliott, making available
the original Elliott writings that had long been out of print.

BASIC TENETS OF THE ELLIOTT
WAVE PRINCIPLE
There are three important aspects of wave theory—pattern, ratio, and
time—in that order of importance. Pattern refers to the wave patterns
or formations that comprise the most important element of the theory.
Ratio analysis is useful in determining retracement points and price
objectives by measuring the relationships between the different
waves. Finally, time relationships also exist and can be used to
confirm the wave patterns and ratios, but are considered by some
Elliotticians to be less reliable in market forecasting.
Elliott Wave Theory was originally applied to the major stock
market averages, particularly the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In
its most basic form, the theory says that the stock market follows a
repetitive rhythm of a five wave advance followed by a three wave
decline. Figure 13.1 shows one complete cycle. If you count the
waves, you will find that one complete cycle has eight waves—five
up and three down. In the advancing portion of the cycle, notice that
each of the five waves are numbered. Waves 1, 3, and 5—called
impulse waves—are rising waves, while waves 2 and 4 move against
the uptrend. Waves 2 and 4 are called corrective waves because they
correct waves 1 and 3. After the five wave numbered advance has
been completed, a three wave correction begins. The three corrective
waves are identified by the letters a, b, c.
Along with the constant form of the various waves, there is
the important consideration of degree. There are many different
degrees of trend. Elliott, in fact, categorized nine different degrees of
trend (or magnitude) ranging from a Grand Supercycle

Wave Principle [Gainesville, GA: New Classics Library, 1978], p. 20.

spanning two hundred years to a subminuette degree covering only a
few hours. The point to remember is that the basic eight wave cycle
remains constant no matter what degree of trend is being studied.
Each wave subdivides into waves of one lesser degree that, in
turn, can also be subdivided into waves of even lesser degree. It also
follows then that each wave is itself part of the wave of the next
higher degree. Figure 13.2 demonstrates these relationships. The
largest two waves—1 and 2—can be subdivided into eight lesser
waves that, in turn, can be subdivided into 34 even lesser waves. The
two largest waves—1 and 2—are only the first two waves in an even
larger five wave advance. Wave 3 of that next higher degree is about
to begin. The 34 waves in Figure 13.2 are subdivided further to the
next smaller degree in Figure 13.3, resulting in 144 waves.

The numbers shown so far 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144— are
not just random numbers. They are part of the Fibonacci number
sequence, which forms the mathematical basis for the Elliott Wave
Theory. We'll come back to them a little later. For now, look at
Figures 13.1-13.3 and notice a very significant characteristic of the
waves. Whether a given wave divides into five waves or three waves
is determined by the direction of the next larger wave. For example,
in Figure 13.2, waves (1), (3), and (5) subdivide into five waves
because the next larger wave of which they are part—wave 1—is an
advancing wave. Because waves (2) and (4) are moving against the
trend, they subdivide into only three waves. Look more closely at
corrective waves (a), (b), and (c), which comprise the larger
corrective wave 2. Notice that the two declining waves—(a) and
(c)—each break down into five waves. This is

www.Fxborssa.com

323

(Frost and Prechter, p. 22. Copyright © 1978 by Frost and

because they are moving in the same direction as the next larger
wave 2. Wave (b) by contrast only has three waves, because it is
moving against the next larger wave 2.
Being able to determine between threes and fives is obviously
of tremendous importance in the application of this approach. That
information tells the analyst what to expect next. A completed five
wave move, for example, usually means that only part of a larger
wave has been completed and that there's more to come (unless it's a
fifth of a fifth). One of the most important rules to remember is that a
correction can never take place in five waves. In a bull market, for
example, if a five wave decline is seen, this means that it is probably
only the first wave of a three wave (a-b-c) decline and that there's
more to come on the downside. In a bear market, a three wave
advance should be followed by resumption of the downtrend. A five
wave rally would warn of a more substantial move to the upside and
might possibly even be the first wave of a new bull trend.

Chapter 13

CONNECTION BETWEEN ELLIOTT
WAVE AND DOW THEORY
Let's take a moment here to point out the obvious connection
between Elliott's idea of five advancing waves and Dow's three
advancing phases of a bull market. It seems clear that Elliott's idea of
three up waves, with two intervening corrections, fits nicely with the
Dow Theory. While Elliott was no doubt influenced by Dow's
analysis, it also seems clear that Elliott believed he had gone well
beyond Dow's theory and had in fact improved on it. It's also
interesting to note the influence of the sea on both men in the
formulation of their theories. Dow compared the major, intermediate,
and minor trends in the market with the tides, waves, and ripples on
the ocean. Elliott referred to "ebbs and flows" in his writing and
named his theory the "wave" principle.

CORRECTIVE WAVES
So far, we've talked mainly about the impulse waves in the direction
of the major trend. Let's turn our attention now to the corrective
waves. In general, corrective waves are less clearly defined and, as a
result, tend to be more difficult to identify and predict. One point that
is clearly defined, however, is that corrective waves can never take
place in five waves. Corrective waves are threes, never fives (with
the exception of triangles). We're going to look at three
classifications of corrective waves—zig-zags, flats, and triangles.
Zig-Zags
A zig-zag is a three wave corrective pattern, against the major trend,
which breaks down into a 5-3-5 sequence. Figures 13.4 and 13.5
show a bull market zig-zag correction, while a bear market rally is
shown in Figures 13.6 and 13.7. Notice that the middle wave B falls
short of the beginning of wave A and that wave C moves well
beyond the end of wave A.
A less common variation of the zig-zag is the double zigzag
shown in Figure 13.8. This variation sometimes occurs in larger
corrective patterns. It is in effect two different 5-3-5 zig-zag patterns
connected by an intervening a-b-c pattern.

Flats

What distinguishes the flat correction from the zig-zag correction is
that the flat follows a 3-3-5 pattern. Notice in Figures 13.10 and
13.12 that the A wave is a 3 instead of a 5. In general, the flat is more
of a consolidation than a correction and is considered a sign of
strength in a bull market. Figures 13.9-13.12 show examples of
normal flats. In a bull market, for example, wave B rallies all the way
to the top of wave A, showing greater market strength. The final
wave C terminates at or just below the bottom of wave A in contrast
to a zig-zag, which moves well under that point.
There are two "irregular" variations of the normal flat correction. Figures 13.13-13.16 show the first type of variation. Notice
in the bull market example (Figures 13.13 and 13.14) that the top of
wave B exceeds the top of A and that wave C violates the bottom of
A.
Another variation occurs when wave B reaches the top of A,
but wave C fails to reach the bottom of A. Naturally, this last pattern
denotes greater market strength in a bull market. This variation is
shown in Figures 13.17-13.20 for bull and bear markets.

Triangles
Triangles usually occur in the fourth wave and precede the final
move in the direction of the major trend. (They can also appear in the
b wave of an a-b-c correction.) In an uptrend, therefore, it can be said
that triangles are both bullish and bearish. They're bullish in the sense
that they indicate resumption of the uptrend. They're bearish because
they also indicate that after one more wave up, prices will probably
peak. (See Figure 13.21.)

Elliott's interpretation of the triangle parallels the classical use
of the pattern, but with his usual added precision. Remember from
Chapter 6 that the triangle is usually a continuation pattern, which is
exactly what Elliott said. Elliott's triangle is a sideways consolidation
pattern that breaks down into five waves, each wave in turn having
three waves of its own. Elliott also classifies four different kinds of
triangles—ascending, descending, symmetrical, and expanding—all
of which were seen in Chapter 6. Figure 13.21 shows the four
varieties in both uptrends and downtrends.
Because chart patterns in commodity futures contracts
sometimes don't form as fully as they do in the stock market, it is not
unusual for triangles in the futures markets to have only three waves
instead of five. (Remember, however, that the minimum requirement
for a triangle is still four points—two upper and two lower—to allow
the drawing of two converging trendlines.) Elliott Wave Theory also
holds that the fifth and last wave within the triangle sometimes
breaks its trendline, giving a false signal, before beginning its
"thrust" in the original direction.
Elliott's measurement for the fifth and final wave after
completion of the triangle is essentially the same as in classical
charting—that is, the market is expected to move the distance that
matches the widest part of the triangle (its height). There is another
point worth noting here concerning the timing of the final top or
bottom. According to Prechter, the apex of the triangle (the point
where the two converging trendlines meet) often marks the timing for
the completion of the final fifth wave.

THE RULE OF ALTERNATION
In its more general application, this rule or principle holds that the
market usually doesn't act the same way two times in a row. If a
certain type of top or bottom occurred the last time around, it will
probably not do so again this time. The rule of alternation doesn't tell
us exactly what will happen, but tells us what probably won't. In its
more specific application, it is most generally used to tell us what
type of corrective pattern to expect. Corrective patterns tend to
alternate. In other words, if corrective

wave 2 was a simple a-b-c pattern, wave 4 will probably be a complex pattern, such as a triangle. Conversely, if wave 2 is complex,
wave 4 will probably be simple. Figure 13.22 gives some examples.

Figure 13.22 The Rule of Alternation. (Frost and Prechter, p. 50.

CHANNELING
Another important aspect of wave theory is the use of price channels.
You'll recall that we covered trend channeling in Chapter 4. Elliott
used price channels as a method of arriving at price objectives and
also to help confirm the completion of wave counts. Once an uptrend
has been established, an initial trend channel is constructed by
drawing a basic up trendline along the bottoms of waves 1 and 2. A
parallel channel line is then drawn over the top of wave 1 as shown
in Figure 13.23. The entire uptrend will often stay within those two
boundaries.
If wave 3 begins to accelerate to the point that it exceeds the
upper channel line, the lines have to be redrawn along the top of
wave 1 and the bottom of wave 2 as shown in Figure 13.23. The final
channel is drawn under the two corrective waves—2 and 4—and
usually above the top of wave 3 as shown in Figure 13.24. If wave 3
is unusually strong, or an extended

Chapter 13

wave, the upper line may have to be drawn over the top of wave 1.
The fifth wave should come close to the upper channel line before
terminating. For the drawing of channel lines on long term trends, it's
recommended that semilog charts be employed along with arithmetic
charts.

WAVE 4 AS A SUPPORT AREA
In concluding our discussion of wave formations and guidelines, one
important point remains to be mentioned, and that is the significance
of wave 4 as a support area in subsequent bear markets. Once five up
waves have been completed and a bear trend has begun, that bear
market will usually not move below the previous fourth wave of one
lesser degree; that is, the last fourth wave that was formed during the
previous bull advance. There are exceptions to that rule, but usually
the bottom of the fourth wave contains the bear market. This piece of
information can prove very useful in arriving at a maximum
downside price objective.

FIBONACCI NUMBERS AS THE
BASIS OF THE WAVE PRINCIPLE
Elliott stated in Nature's Law that the mathematical basis for his
Wave Principle was a number sequence discovered by Leonardo
Fibonacci in the thirteenth century. That number sequence has
become identified with its discoverer and is commonly referred to as
the Fibonacci numbers. The number sequence is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,
21, 34, 55, 89, 144, and so on to infinity.
The sequence has a number of interesting properties, not the
least of which is an almost constant relationship between the
numbers.
1. The sum of any two consecutive numbers equals the next
higher number. For example, 3 and 5 equals 8, 5 and 8 equals
13, and so on.
2. The ratio of any number to its next higher number approaches
.618, after the first four numbers. For example,

www.Fxborssa.com

Elliott Wave Theory

335

1/1 is 1.00, 1/2 is .50, 2/3 is .67, 3/5 is .60, 5/8 is .625, 8/13 is
.615, 13/21 is .619, and so on. Notice how these early ratio
values fluctuate above and below .618 in narrowing amplitude.
Also, notice the values of 1.00, .50, .67. We'll comment further
on these values when we talk more about ratio analysis and
percentage retracements.
3. The ratio of any number to its next lower number is approximately 1.618, or the inverse of .618. For example, 13/8 is
1.625, 21/13 is 1.615, 34/21 is 1.619. The higher the numbers
become, the closer they come to the values of .618 and 1.618.
4. The ratios of alternate numbers approach 2.618 or its inverse,
.382. For example, 13/34 is .382, 34/13 is 2.615.

FIBONACCI RATIOS AND
RETRACEMENTS
It was already stated that wave theory is comprised of three aspects—
wave form, ratio, and time. We've already discussed wave form,
which is the most important of the three. Let's talk now about the
application of the Fibonacci ratios and retracements. These
relationships can apply to both price and time, although the former is
considered to be the more reliable. We'll come back later to the
aspect of time.
First of all, a glance back at Figures 13.1 and 13.3 shows that
the basic wave form always breaks down into Fibonacci numbers.
One complete cycle comprises eight waves, five up and three
down—all Fibonacci numbers. Two further subdivisions will produce
34 and 144 waves—also Fibonacci numbers. The mathematical basis
of the wave theory on the Fibonacci sequence, however, goes beyond
just wave counting. There's also the question of proportional
relationships between the different waves. The following are among
the most commonly used Fibonacci ratios:
1. One of the three impulse waves sometimes extends. The other
two are equal in time and magnitude. If wave 5 extends,
waves 1 and 3 should be about equal. If wave 3 extends,
waves 1 and 5 tend toward equality.

www.Fxborssa.com

336

Chapter 13

2. A minimum target for the top of wave 3 can be obtained by
multiplying the length of wave 1 by 1.618 and adding that
total to the bottom of 2.
3. The top of wave 5 can be approximated by multiplying wave 1
by 3.236 (2x1.618) and adding that value to the top or bottom
of wave 1 for maximum and minimum targets.
4. Where waves 1 and 3 are about equal, and wave 5 is expected
to extend, a price objective can be obtained by measuring the
distance from the bottom of wave 1 to the top of wave 3,
multiplying by 1.618, and adding the result to the bottom of 4.
5. For corrective waves, in a normal 5-3-5 zig-zag correction,
wave c is often about equal to the length of wave a.
6. Another way to measure the possible length of wave c is to
multiply .618 by the length of wave a and subtract that result
from the bottom of wave a.
7. In the case of a flat 3-3-5 correction, where the b wave reaches
or exceeds the top of wave a, wave c will be about 1.618 the
length of a.
8. In a symmetrical triangle, each successive wave is related to
its previous wave by about .618.

Fibonacci Percentage Retracements
The preceding ratios help to determine price objectives in both
impulse and corrective waves. Another way to determine price
objectives is by the use of percentage retracements. The most commonly used numbers in retracement analysis are 61.8% (usually
rounded off to 62%), 38%, and 50%. Remember from Chapter 4 that
markets usually retrace previous moves by certain predictable
percentages—the best known ones being 33%, 50%, and 67%. The
Fibonacci sequence refines those numbers a bit further. In a strong
trend, a minimum retracement is usually around 38%. In a weaker
trend, the maximum percentage retracement is usually 62%. (See
Figures 13.25 and 13.26.)

Chapter 13

It was pointed out earlier, that the Fibonacci ratios approach
.618 only after the first four numbers. The first three ratios are 1/1
(100%), 1/2 (50%), and 2/3 (66%). Many students of Elliott may be
unaware that the famous 50% retracement is actually a Fibonacci
ratio, as is the two-thirds retracement. A complete retracement
(100%) of a previous bull or bear market also should mark an
important support or resistance area.

FIBONACCI TIME TARGETS
We haven't said too much about the aspect of time in wave analysis.
Fibonacci time relationships exist. It's just that they're harder to
predict and are considered by some Elliotticians to be the least
important of the three aspects of the theory. Fibonacci time targets
are found by counting forward from significant tops and bottoms. On
a daily chart, the analyst counts forward the number of trading days
from an important turning point with the expectation that future tops
or bottoms will occur on Fibonacci days—that is, on the 13th, 21st,
34th, 55th, or 89th trading day in the future. The same technique can
be used on weekly, monthly, or even yearly charts. On the weekly
chart, the analyst picks a significant top or bottom and looks for
weekly time targets that fall on Fibonacci numbers. (See Figures
13.27 and 13.28.)

COMBINING ALL THREE ASPECTS
OF WAVE THEORY
The ideal situation occurs when wave form, ratio analysis, and time
targets come together. Suppose that a study of waves reveals that a
fifth wave has been completed, that wave 5 has gone 1.618 times the
distance from the bottom of wave 1 to the top of wave 3, and that the
time from the beginning of the trend has been 13 weeks from a
previous low and 34 weeks from a previous top. Suppose further that
the fifth wave has lasted 21 days. Odds would be pretty good that an
important top was near.

340

Chapter 13

A study of price charts in both stocks and futures markets
reveals a number of Fibonacci time relationships. Part of the problem, however, is the variety of possible relationships. Fibonacci time
targets can be taken from top to top, top to bottom, bottom to bottom,
and bottom to top. These relationships can always be found after the
fact. It's not always clear which of the possible relationships are
relevant to the current trend.

ELLIOTT WAVE APPLIED TO
STOCKS VERSUS COMMODITIES
There are some differences in applying wave theory to stocks and
commodities. For example, wave 3 tends to extend in stocks and
wave 5 in commodities. The unbreakable rule that wave 4 can never
overlap wave 1 in stocks is not as rigid in commodities. (Intraday
penetrations can occur on futures charts.) Sometimes charts of the
cash market in commodities give a clearer Elliott pattern than the
futures market. The use of continuation charts in commodity futures
markets also produces distortions that may affect long term Elliott
patterns.
Possibly the most significant difference between the two
areas is that major bull markets in commodities can be "contained,"
meaning that bull market highs do not always exceed previous bull
market highs. It is possible in commodity markets for a completed
five wave bull trend to fall short of a previous bull market high. The
major tops formed in many commodity markets in the 1980 to 1981
period failed to exceed major tops formed seven and eight years
earlier. As a final comparison between the two areas, it appears that
the best Elliott patterns in commodity markets arise from breakouts
from long term extended bases.
It is important to keep in mind that wave theory was originally meant to be applied to the stock market averages. It doesn't
work as well in individual common stocks. It's quite possible that it
doesn't work that well in some of the more thinly traded futures
markets as well because mass psychology is one of the important
foundations on which the theory rests. Gold, as an illustration, is an
excellent vehicle for wave analysis because of its wide following.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Let's briefly summarize the more important elements of wave theory
and then try to put it into proper perspective.
1. A complete bull market cycle is made up of eight waves, five up
waves followed by three down waves.
2. A trend divides into five waves in the direction of the next
longer trend.
3. Corrections always take place in three waves.
4. The two types of simple corrections are zig-zags (5-3-5) and
flats (3-3-5).
5. Triangles are usually fourth waves, and always precede the final
wave. Triangles can also be B corrective waves.
6. Waves can be expanded into longer waves and subdivided into
shorter waves.
7. Sometimes one of the impulse waves extends. The other two
should then be equal in time and magnitude.
8. The Fibonacci sequence is the mathematical basis of the Elliott
Wave Theory.
9. The number of waves follows the Fibonacci sequence.
10. Fibonacci ratios and retracements are used to determine price
objectives. The most common retracements are 62%, 50%,
and 38%.
11. The rule of alternation warns not to expect the same thing
twice in succession.
12. Bear markets should not fall below the bottom of the previous fourth wave.
13. Wave 4 should not overlap wave 1 (not as rigid in futures).
14. The Elliott Wave Theory is comprised of wave forms, ratios,
and time, in that order of importance.
15. The theory was originally applied to stock market averages
and does not work as well on individual stocks.
16. The theory works best in those commodity markets with the
largest public following, such as gold.

www.Fxborssa.com

342

Chapter 13

17. The principal difference in commodities is the existence of
contained bull markets.
The Elliott Wave Principle builds on the more classical
approaches, such as Dow Theory and traditional chart patterns. Most
of those price patterns can be explained as part of the Elliott Wave
structure. It builds on the concept of "swing objectives" by using
Fibonacci ratio projections and percentage retracements. The Elliott
Wave Principle takes all of these factors into consideration, but goes
beyond them by giving them more order and increased predictability.
Wave Theory Should Be Used in Conjunction
with Other Technical Tools
There are times when Elliott pictures are clear and other times when
they are not. Trying to force unclear market action into an Elliott
format, and ignoring other technical tools in the process, is a misuse
of the theory. The key is to view Elliott Wave Theory as a partial
answer to the puzzle of market forecasting. Using it in conjunction
with all of the other technical theories in this book will increase its
value and improve your chances for success.

Time Cycles * *

INTRODUCTION
Our main focus up to this point has been on price movement, and not
too much has been said about the importance of time in solving the
forecasting puzzle. The question of time has been present by
implication throughout our entire coverage of technical analysis, but
has generally been relegated to secondary consideration. In this
chapter, we're going to view the problem of forecasting through the
eyes of cyclic analysts who believe that time cycles hold the ultimate
key to understanding why markets move up or down. In the process,
we're going to add the important dimension of time to our growing
list of analytical tools. Instead of just asking ourselves which way and
how far a market will go, we'll start asking when it will arrive there or
even when the move will begin. Consider the standard daily bar chart.
The vertical axis gives the price scale. But that's only half of the
relevant data. The horizontal scale gives the time horizon. Therefore,
the bar chart is really a time and price chart. Yet, many traders
concentrate solely on price data to the exclusion of time
considerations. When we

343

www.Fxborssa.com

344

Chapter 14

study chart patterns, we're aware that there is a relationship between
the amount of time it takes for those patterns to form and the
potential for subsequent market moves. The longer a trendline or a
support or resistance level remains in effect, the more valid it
becomes. Moving averages require input as to the proper time period
to use. Even oscillators require some decision as to how many days
to measure. In the previous chapter, we considered the usefulness of
Fibonacci time targets.
It seems clear then that all phases of technical analysis
depend to some extent on time considerations. Yet those considerations are not really applied in a consistent and dependable manner.
That's where time cycles come into play. Instead of playing a
secondary or supporting role in market movement, cyclic analysts
hold that time cycles are the determining factor in bull and bear
markets. Not only is time the dominant factor, but all other technical
tools can be improved by incorporating cycles. Moving averages and
oscillators, for example, can be optimized by tying them to dominant
cycles. Trendline analysis can be made more precise with cyclic
analysis by determining which are valid trendlines and which are not.
Price pattern analysis can be enhanced if combined with cyclic peaks
and troughs. By the use of "time windows," price movement can be
filtered in such a way that extraneous action can be ignored and
primary emphasis placed only on such times when important cycle
tops and bottoms are due to occur.

CYCLES
The most intriguing book I've ever read on the subject of cycles was
written by Edward R. Dewey, one of the pioneers of cyclic analysis,
with Og Mandino entitled Cycles: The Mysterious Forces That
Trigger Events. Thousands of seemingly unrelated cycles were
isolated spanning hundreds and, in some cases, thousands of years.
Everything from the 9.6 year cycle in Atlantic salmon abundance to
the 22.20 year cycle in international battles from 1415 to 1930 was
tracked. An average cycle of sunspot activity since 1527 was found
to be 11.11 years. Several economic cycles, including the 18.33 year
cycle in real estate activity and a 9.2 year stock market cycle, were
presented. (See Figures 14.1 and 14.2.)

Time Cycles

Two startling conclusions are discussed by Dewey. First, that
many of the cycles of seemingly unrelated phenomena clustered
around similar periods. On p. 188 of his book, Dewey listed 37
different examples of the 9.6 year cycle, including caterpillar
abundance in New Jersey, coyote abundance in Canada, wheat
acreage in the U.S., and cotton prices in the U.S. Why should such
unrelated activities show the same cycles?
The second discovery was that these similar cycles acted in
synchrony, that is, they turned at the same time. Figure 14.3

Chapter 14

shows 12 different examples of the 18.2 year cycle including marriages, immigration, and stock prices in the U.S. Dewey's startling
conclusion was that something "out there" in the universe must be
causing these cycles; that there seemed to be a sort of pulse to the
universe that accounted for the pervasive presence of these cycles
throughout so many areas of human existence.
In 1941, Dewey organized the Foundation for the Study of
Cycles (900 W. Valley Rd., Suite 502, Wayne, PA 19087). It is the
oldest organization engaged in cycles research and the recognized
leader in the field. The Foundation publishes Cycles magazine, which
presents research in many different areas including economics and
business. It also publishes a monthly report, Cycle Projections, which
applies cyclical analysis to stocks, commodities, real estate and the
economy.
Basic Cyclic Concepts
In 1970, J.M. Hurst authored The Profit Magic of Stock Transaction
Timing. Although it deals mainly with stock market cycles, this book
represents one of the best explanations of cycle theory available in
print, and is highly recommended reading. The following diagrams
are derived from Hurst's original work.
First, let's see what a cycle looks like and discuss its three
main characteristics. Figure 14.4 shows two repetitions of a price
cycle. The cycle bottoms are called troughs and the tops referred to
as crests. Notice that the two waves shown here are measured from
trough to trough. Cyclic analysts prefer to measure cycle lengths from
low to low. Measurements can be taken between crests, but they are
not considered to be as stable or reliable as those taken between the
troughs. Therefore, common practice is to measure the beginning and
end of a cyclic wave at a low point, as shown in this example.
The three qualities of a cycle are amplitude, period, and phase.
Amplitude measures the height of the wave as shown in Figure 14.5,
and is expressed in dollars, cents, or points. The period of a wave, as
shown in Figure 14.6, is the time between troughs. In this example,
the period is 20 days. The phase is a measure of the time location of a
wave trough. In Figure 14.7, the phase difference between two waves
is shown. Because there are several different

kind that combines to form stock and commodity price action. Only two cycles
of this wave are shown, but the wave itself extends infinitely far to the left and to
the right. Such waves repeat themselves cycle after cycle. As a result, once the
wave is identified, its value can be determined at any past or future time. It is
this characteristic of waves that provides a degree of predictability for equity
price action.

cycles occurring at the same time, phasing allows the cyclic analyst
to study the relationships between the different cycle lengths. Phasing
is also used to identify the date of the last cycle low. If, for example,
a 20 day cycle bottomed 10 days earlier, the date of the next cycle
low can be determined. Once the amplitude, period, and phase of a
cycle are known, the cycle can theoretically be extrapolated into the
future. Assuming the cycle remains fairly constant, it can then be
used to estimate future peaks and troughs. That is the basis of the
cyclic approach in its simplest form.

20 days, which is shown measured between two consecutive wave troughs. The
period could just as well have been measured between wave crests. But in the
case of price waves, the wave troughs are usually more clearly defined than the
wave crests for reasons that will be discussed later. Consequently, price wave
periods are most often measured from trough to trough.

between the two waves shown is 6 days. This phase difference is measured
between the troughs of the two waves because, again, wave troughs are the most
convenient points to identify in the case of price waves.

Cyclic Principles
Let's take a look now at some of the principles that underlie the
cyclic philosophy. The four most important ones are the Principles of
Summation, Harmonicity, Synchronicity, and Proportionality.
The Principle of Summation holds that all price movement is
the simple addition of all active cycles. Figure 14.8 demonstrates how
the price pattern on the top is formed by simply adding together the
two different cycles at the bottom of the chart. Notice, in particular,
the appearance of the double top in composite wave C. Cycle theory
holds that all price patterns are formed by the interaction of two or
more different cycles. We'll come back to this point again. The
Principle of Summation gives us an important insight into the
rationale of cyclic forecasting. Let's assume that all price action is
just the sum of different cycle lengths. Assume further that each of
those individual cycles could be isolated and measured. Assume also
that each of those cycles will continue to fluctuate into the future.
Then by simply continuing each cycle into the future and summing
them back together again, the future price trend should be the result.
Or, so the theory goes.

352

Chapter 14

Figure 14.8 The summation of two waves. The dotted lines show how, at
each point in time, the value of wave A is added to the value of wave B to
produce the value of composite wave C.

The Principle of Harmonicity simply means that neighboring
waves are usually related by a small, whole number. That number is
usually two. For example, if a 20 day cycle exists, the next shorter
cycle will usually be half its length, or 10 days. The next longer cycle
would then be 40 days. If you'll remember back to the discussion on
the 4 week rule (Chapter 9), the principle of harmonics was invoked
to explain the validity of using a shorter 2 week rule and a longer 8
weeks.

Time Cycles

353

The Principle of Synchronicity refers to the strong tendency
for waves of differing lengths to bottom at about the same time.
Figure 14.9 is meant to show both harmonicity and synchronicity.
Wave B at the bottom of the chart is half the length of wave A. Wave
A includes two repetitions of the smaller wave B, showing
harmonicity between the two waves. Notice also that when wave A
bottoms, wave B tends to do the same, demonstrating synchronicity
between the two. Synchronicity also means that similar cycle lengths
of different markets will tend to turn together.
The Principle of Proportionality describes the relationship
between cycle period and amplitude. Cycles with longer periods
(lengths) should have proportionally wider amplitudes. The
amplitude, or height, of a 40 day cycle, for example, should be about
double that of a 20 day cycle.
The Principles of Variation and Nominality
There are two other cyclic principles that describe cycle behavior in a
more general sense—The Principles of Variation and Nominality.
The Principle of Variation, as the name implies, is a recognition of the fact that all of the other cyclic principles already
mentioned—summation, harmonicity, synchronicity, and proportionality—are just strong tendencies and not hard and fast rules.
Some "variation" can and usually does occur in the real world.
The Principle of Nominality is based on the premise that,
despite the differences that exist in the various markets and allowing
for some variation in the implementing of cyclic principles, there
seems to be a nominal set of harmonically related cycles that affect
all markets. And that nominal model of cycle lengths can be used as a
starting point in the analysis of any market. Figure 14.10 shows a
simplified version of that nominal model. The model begins with an
18 year cycle and proceeds to each successively lower cycle half its
length. The only exception is the relationship between 54 and 18
months which is a third instead of a half.
When we discuss the various cycle lengths in the individual
markets, we'll see that this nominal model does account for most
cyclic activity. For now, look at the "Days" column. Notice

numbers account for most of the popular moving average lengths.
Even the well known 4, 9, and 18 day moving average technique is a
variation of the 5, 10, and 20 day numbers. Many oscillators use 5,
10, and 20 days. Weekly rule breakouts use the same numbers
translated into 2, 4, and 8 weeks.

HOW CYCLIC CONCEPTS HELP
EXPLAIN CHARTING TECHNIQUES
Chapter 3 in Hurst's book explains in great detail how the standard
charting techniques—trendlines and channels, chart patterns, and
moving averages—can be better understood and used to greater
advantage when coordinated with cyclic1; principles. Figure 14.11
helps explain the existence of trendlines and channels. The flat cycle
wave along the bottom becomes a rising price channel when it is
summed with a rising line representing the long term uptrend. Notice
how much the horizontal cycle along the bottom of the chart
resembles an oscillator.

components. Hurst goes on to explain double tops, triangles, flags,
and pennants through the application of cycles. The "V" top or
bottom, for example, occurs when an intermediate cycle turns at the
exact same time as its next longer and next shorter duration cycles.
Hurst also addresses how moving averages can be made more
useful if their lengths are synchronized with dominant cycle lengths.
Students of traditional charting techniques should gain additional
insight into how these popular chart pictures form and maybe even
why they work by reading Hurst's chapter, entitled "Verify Your

DOMINANT CYCLES
There are many different cycles
affecting the financial markets.
The only ones of real value for
forecasting purposes are the
dominant cycles. Dominant
cycles
are
those
that
consistently affect prices and
that can be clearly identified.
Most futures markets have at
least five dominant cycles. In an
earlier chapter on the use of
long term charts, it was stressed
that all technical analysis
should begin with the long term
picture, gradually working
toward the shorter term. That
principle holds true in the study
of cycles. The proper procedure
is to begin

the analysis with a study of long term dominant cycles, which can
span several years; then work toward the intermediate, which can be
several weeks to several months; finally, the very short term cycles,
from several hours to several days, can be used for timing of entry
and exit points and to help confirm the turning points of the longer
cycles.
Classification of Cycles

The general categories are: long term cycles (2 or more years in
length), the seasonal cycle (1 year), the primary or intermediate cycle
(9 to 26 weeks), and the trading cycle (4 weeks). The trading cycle
breaks down into two shorter alpha and beta cycles, which average 2
weeks each. (The labels Primary, Trading, Alpha, and Beta are used
by Walt Bressert to describe the various cycle lengths.) (See Figure
14.13.)
The Kondratieff Wave
There are even longer range cycles at work. Perhaps the best known
is the approximate 54 year Kondratieff cycle. This controversial long
cycle of economic activity, first discovered by a Russian economist in
the 1920s by the name of Nikolai D. Kondratieff, appears to exert a
major influence on virtually all stock and commodity prices. In
particular, a 54 year cycle has been identified in interest rates, copper,
cotton, wheat, stocks, and wholesale commodity prices. Kondratieff
tracked his "long wave" from 1789 using such factors as commodity
prices, pig iron production, and wages of agricultural workers in
England. (See Figure 14.14.) The Kondratieff cycle has become a
popular subject of discussion in recent years, primarily owing to the
fact that its last top occurred in the 1920s, and its next top is long
overdue. Kondratieff himself paid a heavy price for his cyclic view of
capitalistic economies. He is believed to have died in a Siberian labor
camp. For more information, see The Long Wave Cycle (Kondratieff),
translated by Guy Daniels. (Two other books on the subject are The K
Wave by David Knox Barker and The Great Cycle by Dick Stoken.)

COMBINING CYCLE LENGTHS
As a general rule, long term and seasonal cycles determine the major
trend of a market. Obviously, if a two year cycle has bottomed, it can
be expected to advance for at least a year, measured from its trough
to its crest. Therefore, the long term cycle exerts major influence on
market direction. Markets also have annual seasonal patterns,
meaning that they tend to peak or trough at certain times of the year.
Grain markets, for example, usually hit their low point around harvest
time and rally from there. Seasonal moves usually last for several
months.
For trading purposes, the weekly primary cycle is the most
useful. The 3 to 6 month primary cycle is the equivalent of the
intermediate trend, and generally determines which side of a market
to trade. The next shorter cycle, the 4 week trading cycle, is used to
establish entry and exit points in the direction of the primary trend. If
the primary trend is up, troughs in the trading cycle are used for
purchases. If the primary trend is down, crests in the trading cycles
should be sold short. The 10 day alpha and beta cycles can be used
for further fine tuning. (See Figure 14.13.)

THE IMPORTANCE OF TREND
The concept of trading in the direction of the trend is stressed
throughout the body of technical analysis. In an earlier chapter, it was
suggested that short term dips should be used for purchases if the
intermediate trend was up, and that short term bulges be sold in
downtrends. In the chapter on Elliott Wave Theory, it was pointed out
that five wave moves only take place in the direction of the next
larger trend. Therefore, it is necessary when using any short term
trend for timing purposes to first determine the direction of the next
longer trend and then trade in the direction of that longer trend. That
concept holds true in cycles. The trend of each cycle is determined by
the direction of its next longer cycle. Or stated the other way, once the
trend of a longer cycle is established, the trend of the next shorter
cycle is known.

Chapter 14

The 28 Day Trading Cycle in Commodities
There is one important short term cycle that tends to influence most
commodity markets—the 28 day trading cycle. In other words, most
markets have a tendency to form a trading cycle low every 4 weeks.
One possible explanation for this strong cyclic tendency throughout
all commodity markets is the lunar cycle. Burton Pugh studied the 28
day cycle in the wheat market in the 1930s (Science and Secrets of
Wheat Trading, Lambert-Gann, Pomeroy, WA, 1978, orig., 1933)
and concluded that the moon had some influence on market turning
points. His theory was that wheat should be bought on a full moon
and sold on a new moon. Pugh acknowledged, however, that the
lunar effects were mild and could be overridden by the effects of
longer cycles or important news events.
Whether or not the moon has anything to do with it, the
average 28 day cycle does exist and explains many of the numbers
used in the development of shorter term indicators and trading
systems. First of all, the 28 day cycle is based on calendar days.
Translated into actual trading days, the number becomes 20. We've
already commented on how many popular moving averages,
oscillators, and weekly rules are based on the number 20 and its
harmonically related shorter cycles, 10 and 5. The 5, 10, and 20 day
moving averages are widely used along with their derivatives, 4, 9,
and 18. Many traders use 10 and 40 day moving averages, with the
number 40 being the next harmonically related longer cycle at twice
the length of 20.
In Chapter 9, we discussed the profitability of the 4 week rule
developed by Richard Donchian. Buy signals were generated when a
market set new 4 week highs and a sell signal when a 4 week low
was established. Knowledge of the existence of a 4 week trading
cycle gives a better insight into the significance of that number and
helps us to understand why the 4 week rule has worked so well over
the years. When a market exceeds the high of the previous 4 weeks,
cycle logic tells us that, at the very least, the next longer cycle (the 8
week cycle) has bottomed and turned up.

LEFT AND RIGHT TRANSLATION
The concept of translation may very well be the most useful aspect of
cycle analysis. Left and right translation refers to the

www.Fxborssa.com

Time Cycles

363

shifting of the cycle peaks either to the left or the right of the ideal
cycle midpoint. For example, a 20 day trading cycle is measured from
low to low. The ideal peak should occur 10 days into the cycle, or at
the halfway point. That would allow for a 10 day advance followed
by a 10 day decline. Ideal cycle peaks, however, rarely occur. Most
variations in cycles occur at the peaks (or crests) and not at the
troughs. That's why cycle troughs are considered more reliable and
are used to measure cycle lengths.
The cycle crests act differently depending on the trend of the
next longer cycle. If the trend is up, the cycle crest shifts to the right
of the ideal midpoint, causing right translation. If the longer trend is
down, the cycle crest shifts to the left of the midpoint, causing left
translation. Therefore, right translation is bullish and left translation
is bearish. Stop to think about it. All we're saying here is that in a bull
trend, prices will spend more time going up than down. In a bear
trend, prices spend more time going down than up. Isn't that the basic
definition of a trend? Only, in this case, we're talking about time
instead of price. (See Figure 14.15.)

HOW TO ISOLATE CYCLES
In order to study the various cycles affecting any given market, it is
necessary to first isolate each dominant cycle. There are various ways
of accomplishing this task. The simplest is by visual inspection. By
studying daily bar charts, for example, it is possible to identify
obvious tops and bottoms in a market. By taking the average time
periods between those cyclic tops and bottoms, certain average
lengths can be found.
There are tools available to make that task a bit easier. One
such tool is the Ehrlich Cycle Finder, named after its inventor, Stan
Ehrlich (ECF, 112 Vida Court, Novato, CA 94947 [415] 892-1183).
The Cycle Finder is an accordion-like device that can be placed on
the price chart for visual inspection. The distance between the points
is always equidistant and can be expanded or contracted to fit any
cycle length. By plotting a distance between any two obvious cycle
lows, it can be quickly determined if other cycle lows of

Computers can help you find cycles by visual inspection. The
user first puts a price chart on the screen. The next step is to pick a
prominent bottom on the chart as a starting point. Once that is done,
vertical lines (or arcs) appear every 10 days (the default value). The
cycle periods can be lengthened, shortened, or moved left or right to
find the right cycle fit on the chart. (See Figures 14.19 and 14.20.)

SEASONAL CYCLES
All markets are affected to some extent by an annual seasonal cycle.
The seasonal cycle refers to the tendency for markets to move in a
given direction at certain times of the year. The most obvious
seasonals involve the grain markets where seasonal lows usually
occur around harvest time when supply is most plentiful. In soybeans,
for example, most seasonal tops occur between April and June with
seasonal bottoms taking place between August and October. (See
Figure 14.21.) One well known seasonal pattern is the "February
Break" where grain and soybean prices usually drop from late
December or early January into February.

Although the reasons for seasonal tops and bottoms are more
obvious in the agricultural markets, virtually all markets experience
seasonal patterns. Copper, for example, shows a strong seasonal
uptrend from the January/February period with a tendency to top in
March or April. (See Figure 14.22.) Silver has a low in January with
higher prices into March. Gold shows a tendency to bottom in
August. Petroleum products have a tendency to peak during October
and usually don't bottom until the end of the winter. (See Figure
14.23.) Financial markets also have seasonal patterns.

STOCK MARKET CYCLES
Did you know that the strongest three month span for the stock
market is November through January? February is then weaker, but is
followed by a strong March and April. After a soft June, the market
turns strong during July (the start of the traditional summer rally).
The weakest month of the year is September. The strongest month is
December (ending with the well known Santa Claus rally just after
Christmas). That information, and a whole lot more about stock
market cycles, can be found in Yale Hirsch's annual Stock Trader's
Almanac (The Hirsch Organization, 184 Central Avenue, Old
Tappen, NJ 07675).

THE JANUARY BAROMETER
According to Hirsch: "as January goes, so goes the year." The well
known January Barometer holds that what the S&P 500 does during
January will determine what kind of year the market as a whole will
have. Another variation on that theme is the belief that the direction
of the S&P 500 during the first 5 trading days of the year gives some
hint of what's ahead for the year. The January Barometer shouldn't be
confused with the January Effect, which is the tendency for smaller
stocks to outperform larger stocks during January.

THE PRESIDENTIAL CYCLE
Another well known cycle that affects stock market behavior is the 4
year cycle, also called the Presidential Cycle, because it coincides
with the elected term of U.S. presidents. Each of the 4 years has a
different historical return. The election year (1) is normally strong.
The postelection and midyears (2 and 3) are normally weak. The
preelection year (4) is normally strong. According to Hirsch's
Trader's Almanac, election years since 1904 have seen averages
gains of 224%; postelection years, gains of 72%; midterm years,
gains of 63%; and preelection years, gains of 217%. (See Figure
14.16.)

COMBINING CYCLES WITH
OTHER TECHNICAL TOOLS
Two of the most promising areas of overlap between cycles and
traditional technical indicators are in the use of moving averages and
oscillators. It is believed that the usefulness of both indicators can be
enhanced if the time periods used are tied to each market's dominant
cycles. Let's assume that a market has a dominant 20 day trading
cycle. Normally, when constructing an oscillator, it's best to use half
the length of the cycle. In this case, the oscillator period would be 10
days. To trade a 40 day cycle, use a 20 day oscillator. Walt Bressert
discusses in his book, The Power of Oscillator/Cycle Combinations,
how cycles can be used to adjust time spans for the Commodity
Channel Index, the Relative Strength Index, Stochastics, and Moving
Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).
Moving averages can also be tied to cycles. You could use
different moving averages to track different cycle lengths. To generate a moving average crossover system for a 40 day cycle, you
could use a 40 day moving average in conjunction with a 20 day
average (one-half of the 40 day cycle) or a 10 day average (onequarter of the 40 day cycle). The main problem with this approach is
determining what the dominant cycles are at a particular point in
time.

MAXIMUM ENTROPY
SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
The search for the right dominant cycles in any market is complicated
by the belief that cycle lengths aren't static; in other words, they keep
changing over time. What worked a month ago may not work a
month from now. In his book, MESA and Trading Market Cycles,
John Ehlers uses a statistical approach called Maximum Entropy
Spectral Analysis (MESA). Ehlers explains that one of the main
advantages of MESA is its high-resolution measurement of cycles
with relatively small time periods, which is crucial for shorter term
trading. Ehlers also explains how cycles can be used to optimize
moving average lengths and many of the

www.Fxborssa.com

Time Cycles

375

oscillator-type indicators we've already mentioned. Uncovering
cycles allows for the dynamic adjusting of technical indicators to fit
current market conditions. Ehlers also addresses the problem of
distinguishing between a market in a cycle mode versus one that is in
a trend mode. When a market is in a trend mode, a trend-following
indicator like a moving average is needed to implement trades. A
cycle mode would favor the use of oscillator-type indicators. Cycle
measurement can help determine which mode the market is currently
in, and which type of technical indicator is more appropriate to use
for trading strategies.

CYCLE READING AND SOFTWARE
Most of the books referred to in this chapter on cycles can be
obtained through mail order firms like Traders Press (see reference in
previous chapter) or Traders' Library, P.O. Box 2466, Ellicott City,
MD 21041, [800] 272-2855). There's also a lot more software to help
you perform cycle analysis with your computer. The Ehrlich Cycle
Forecaster and Walt Bressert's CycleTrader are both available as addon options to run with charting software provided by Omega
Research. Bressert's CycleTrader integrates the concepts he describes
in his book, The Power of Oscillator/Cycle Combinations. (Bressert
Marketing Group, 100 East Walton, Suite 200, Chicago, IL 60611
(312) 867-8701). More information on the MESA computer program
can be gotten from John Ehlers (Box 1801, Goleta, CA 93116 (805)

Computers and
Trading Systems

INTRODUCTION
The computer has played an increasingly important role in the field of
technical analysis. In this chapter, we'll see how the computer can
make the technical trader's task a good deal easier by providing quick
and easy access to an arsenal of technical tools and studies that would
have required an enormous amount of work just a few years earlier.
This assumes, of course, that the trader knows how to use these tools,
which brings us to one of the disadvantages of the computer.
The trader not properly schooled in the concepts that underlie
the various indicators, and who is not comfortable with how each
indicator is interpreted, may find him- or herself overwhelmed with
the vast array of computer software currently available. Even worse,
the amount of impressive technical data at one's fingertips sometimes
fosters a false sense of security and competence. Traders mistakenly
assume that they are automatically better simply because they have
access to so much computer power.

Chapter 15

The theme emphasized in this discussion is that the computer
is an extremely valuable tool in the hands of a technically oriented
trader who has already done his or her basic homework. When we
review many of the routines available in the computer, you'll see that
a fair number of the tools and indicators are quite basic and have
already been covered in previous chapters. There are, of course, more
sophisticated tools that require more advanced charting software.
Much of the work involved in technical analysis can be
performed without the computer. Certain functions can be more
easily performed with a simple chart and ruler than with a computer
printout. Some types of longer range analysis don't require a
computer. As useful as it is, the computer is only a tool. It can make a
good technical analyst even better. It won't, however, turn a poor
technician into a good one.
Charting Software
Several of the technical routines available in charting software have
been covered in previous chapters. We'll review some of the tools
and indicators currently available. We'll then address some additional
features such as the ability to automate the various functions chosen
by the user. In addition to providing us with the various technical
studies, the computer also enables us to test various studies for
profitability, which may be the most valuable feature of the program.
Some software allows the user, with little or no programming
background, to construct indicators and systems.
Welles Wilder's Directional Movement and
Parabolic Systems
We'll take a close look at a couple of Welles Wilder's more popular
systems, the Directional Movement System and the Parabolic System.
We'll use those two systems in our discussion of the relative merits of
relying on mechanical trading systems. It will be demonstrated that
mechanical trend following systems only work well in certain types
of market environments. It will also be shown how a mechanical
system can be incorporated into one's market analysis and used
simply as a confirming technical indicator.

Too Much of a Good Thing
It may strike you that there are too many indicators from which to
choose. Instead of simplifying our lives, has the computer only
served to complicate things by giving us so much more to look at?
Charting packages offer 80 different studies that are available to the
technician. How does one possibly reach any conclusions (and find
the time to trade) with so much data to contend with? We'll say a few
words about some work being done in that direction.

SOME COMPUTER NEEDS
Charting software can be applied to virtually any financial market.
Most software is user-friendly, meaning that it can be easily
implemented by choosing from successive lists of available routines.
The place to start is with a charting software package that works for
the computer you already own or are thinking of buying. Bear in
mind that most charting software has been written for IBMcompatible computers.
Charting packages do not provide daily market data. The user
must obtain that data elsewhere. Data can be collected automatically
from a data service over telephone lines (requiring a phone modem).
Charting packages provide the names of various data vendors from
which to choose. These data vendors provide all the software and
instructions needed to set up and collect the data files.
When first starting out, the user must collect historical data
going back for at least several months to have something to work
with. After that, data should be collected daily. It is possible to
analyze "on line" data during the trading day by hooking up to a
quote service. However, in our use of daily data, we will be referring
to end-of-day data, which is available after the markets close. The
final piece of equipment you might want is a printer to obtain a copy
of whatever appears on the terminal screen. CD-Rom capability is
highly recommended since some software vendors provide you with
several years of historical data on a CD-Rom disk to

www.Fxborssa.com

Chapter 15

get you started. There are some data vendors that also provide
charting capability, which simplifies your task even more. One such
service is Telescan (5959 Corporate Drive, Suite 2000, Houston, TX
77036, (800) 324-8246, www.telescan.com).

USING THE TOOLS
AND INDICATORS
How does one cope with so much from which to choose? A suggestion is to first use the basic tools such as price, volume, trendlines, percentage retracements, moving averages, and oscillators.
Notice the large number of oscillators available. Pick one or two that
you are most comfortable with and go with them. Use such things as
cycles and Fibonacci tools as secondary inputs unless you have a
special interest in those areas. Cycles can help fine

tune moving average and oscillator lengths, but require study and
practice. For mechanical trading systems, Wilder's Parabolic and
DMI are especially noteworthy.

WELLES WILDER'S PARABOLIC
AND DIRECTIONAL MOVEMENT
SYSTEMS
We're going to spend some time on two studies that are especially
useful. Both studies were developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and discussed in his book, New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems. Three
of Wilder's other studies included on the computer menu—
Commodity Selection Index, Relative Strength Index, and the Swing
Index—are also included in the same book.
Parabolic System (SAR)
Wilder's Parabolic system (SAR) is a time/price reversal system that
is always in the market. The letters "SAR" stand for "stop and
reverse," meaning that the position is reversed when the protective
stop is hit. It is a trend-following system. It gets its name from the
shape assumed by the trailing stops that tend to curve like a parabola.
(See Figures 15.1-15.4. Notice that as prices trend higher, the rising
dots below the price action (the stop and reverse points) tend to start
out slower and then accelerate with the trend. In a downtrend, the
same thing happens but in the opposite direction (the dots are above
the price action). The SAR numbers are calculated and available to
the user for the following day. Wilder built an acceleration factor into
the system. Each day the stop moves in the direction of the new trend.
At first, the movement of the stop is relatively slow to allow the trend
time to become established. As the acceleration factor increases, the
SAR begins to move faster, eventually catching up to the price action.
If the trend falters, or fails to materialize, the result is usually a stop
and reverse signal. As the accompanying charts show, the Parabolic
system works extremely well in trending markets. Notice that while
the trending portions were captured well, the system whipsawed
constantly during the sideways, nontrending periods.

www.Fxborssa.com

Figure 15.1 The Parabolic SARs look like dots on the chart. A buy signal
was given when the upper SAR was hit (first arrow). Notice how the SARs
accelerated upward during the rally and caught most of the uptrend. A small
whipsaw occurred to the upper right, which was quickly corrected. This system works when a trend is present.

That demonstrates both the strength and weakness of most
trend-following systems. They work well during strong trending
periods, which Wilder himself estimates occur only about 30% of the
time. If that estimate is even close to reality, then a trend-following
system will not work for about 70% of the time. How then does one
deal with this problem?
DMI and ADX
One possible solution is to use some type of filter or a device to
determine if the market is in a trending mode. Wilder's ADX line
rates the directional movement of the various markets on a scale of 0
to 100. A rising ADX line means the market is trending and a better
candidate for a trend-following system. A falling ADX line indicates
a nontrending environment, which would not be suitable for a trendfollowing approach. (See Figure 15.5.)

Figure 15.5 The ADX line measures the degree of directional movement. A
downturn from above 40 (left arrow) signaled the onset of a trading range. The
upturn from below 20 (right arrow) signaled the resumption of a trending phase.

www.Fxborssa.com

Computers and Trading Systems

385

Because the ADX line is on a scale from 0 to 100, the trend
trader could simply trade those markets with the highest trend ratings.
Nontrending systems (oscillators, for example) could be utilized on
markets with low directional movement.
Directional Movement can be used either as a system on its
own or as a filter on the Parabolic or any other trend-following
system. Two lines are generated in the DMI study, +DI and -DI. The
first line measures positive (upward) movement and the second
number, negative (downward) movement). Figure 15.6 shows the two
lines. The darker line is + DI and the lighter line -DI. A buy signal is
given when the +DI line crosses over the - DI line and a sell signal
when it crosses below the - DI line.
Figure 15.6 also shows both the Parabolic and Directional
Movement systems. The Parabolic is clearly a more sensitive sys-

Figure 15.6 The Directional Movement lines along the bottom of the chart
can be used as a filter on Parabolics (upper chart). When the +DI line is above
the -DI line (far left and far right of chart), all Parabolic sell signals can be
ignored. That would have eliminated several whipsaws during the rally phases.

www.Fxborssa.com

386

Chapter 15

tern, meaning that more frequent and earlier signals are given.
However, by using the Directional Movement as a filter, several of
the bad signals in the Parabolic could be avoided by following only
those signals in the same direction as the Directional Movement
lines. It appears then that the Parabolic and Directional Movement
systems should be used together, with Directional Movement acting
as a screen or filter on the more sensitive Parabolic.
The best time to use a trending system is when the ADX line
is rising. (See Figures 15.7 and 15.8.) Be forewarned, however, that
when the ADX line starts to drop from above the 40 level, that is an
early sign that the trend is weakening. A rise back above the 20 level
is often a sign of the start of a new trend. (The ADX line is
essentially a smoothed difference between the +DI and -DI lines.)

PROS AND CONS OF
SYSTEM TRADING
Advantages of Mechanical Systems
1. Human emotion is eliminated.
2. Greater discipline is achieved.
3. More consistency is possible.
4. Trades are taken in the direction of the trend.
5. Participation is virtually guaranteed in the direction of every
important trend.
6. Profits are allowed to run.
7. Losses are minimized.

www.Fxborssa.com

388

Chapter 15

Disadvantages of Mechanical Systems
1. Most mechanical systems are trend-following.
2. Trend-following systems rely on major trends in order to be
profitable.
3. Trend-following systems are generally nonprofitable when
markets are not trending.
4. There are long periods of time when markets are not trending
and, therefore, not suitable for a trending approach.
The major problem is the failure of the system to recognize
when the market is not trending and its inability to turn itself off. The
measure of a good system is not only its ability to make money in
trending markets, but its ability to preserve capital during
nontrending periods. It is this inability of the system to monitor itself
that is its greatest weakness. This is where some overriding filtering
device, such as Welles Wilder's Directional Movement system or the
ADX line could prove especially useful by allowing the trader to
determine which markets are most suitable for a trending system.
Another drawback is that no allowance is generally made for
anticipating market reversals. Trend-following systems ride with the
trend until it turns. They don't recognize when a market has reached a
long term support or resistance level, when oscillator divergences are
being given, or when an Elliott Wave fifth pattern is clearly visible.
Most traders would get more defensive at that point, and begin taking
some profits. The system, however, will stay with the position until
well after the market has changed direction. Therefore, it's up to the
trader to determine how best to employ the system. That is to say,
whether it should be followed blindly or whether it should be
incorporated into a trading plan with other technical factors. That
brings us to our next section on how a mechanical system can be used
as just another technical input into the forecasting and trading
process.

Using System Signals as a
Disciplining Device
The system signals can be used simply as a mechanical confirmation
along with other technical factors. Even if the system is not being
traded mechanically, and other technical factors are being employed,
the signals could be used as a disciplined way to keep the trader on
the right side of the major trend. No short positions would be taken as
long as the computer trend was up. No longs would be taken in a
computer downtrend. (This would be a simple way for fundamentally
oriented traders to use a technical device as a filter or trigger on their
own trading ideas.) Trend direction can be a matter of judgment. The
computer signals relieve the trader of some degree of uncertainty.
They can prevent him or her from falling into the trap of "top and
bottom picking."
Using Signals as Alerts
System signals can also be used as an excellent screening device to
alert the trader to recent trend changes. The trader can simply glance
at the trend signals and instantly has several trading candidates. The
same information could be found by studying all of the charts. The
computer just makes that task quicker, easier, and more authoritative.
The ability of the computer to automate system signals and then alert
the trader when signals are triggered is an enormous asset, especially
when the universe of financial markets has grown so large.

NEED EXPERT HELP?
One of the products offered by Omega Research called TradeStation
offers a variety of Expert Features (Omega Research, Miami, FL

which interprets indicators for you based on current market
conditions. Omega's Expert Analyst will determine

which indicators should work best in the current market and interpret
them for you. In addition, it has two Expert Tools. The Trendlines
Automatic Indicator actually draws trendlines for you. The
Candlestick Patterns Indicator reads the more common candlestick
chart patterns.

TEST SYSTEMS OR CREATE
YOUR OWN
Omega Research also includes a library of the most popular trading
systems used by traders. You can test them, change them, or create
your own if you wish. All of Omega's charting tools, indicators, and
trading systems are written in a relatively simple language called
EasyLanguage. EasyLanguage takes trading ideas that you have
described in plain language and converts them into the machine code
needed to run the program. It's hard to overestimate the value of
being able to develop, test, optimize if you wish, and then automate
your own trading ideas—without being a computer programmer. The
computer will even generate the appropriate trading orders for you
and alert you via your alphanumeric pager that signals have been
triggered. (In Appendix C, we'll use Omega Research's
EasyLanguage and TradeStation to show you how to go about
creating a trading system of your own.)

CONCLUSION
This chapter introduced a couple more of Welles Wilder's systems to
you—Parabolics and Directional Movement (DMI). Parabolics can
generate useful trading signals, but probably shouldn't be used alone.
The two Dl lines can be used as a filter on Parabolics or any other
sensitive trend-following trading system. The ADX line, which is
part of the DMI system, provides one way to determine which type of
market you're dealing with—a trending or a trading market. A rising
ADX line suggests a trend and favors moving averages. A falling
ADX line suggests a trading range and favors oscillators. We also
used the Parabolic examples to show

www.Fxborssa.com

Computers and Trading Systems

391

the good and bad sides of most trend-following systems. They work
well when a trend is present. They're useless during a trading range.
You have to be able to tell the difference. We also touched on the
merits of mechanical trading systems. These systems remove human
emotion and can be very helpful in the right market climate. They can
also be used as technical alerts and used in conjunction with
fundamental analysis. (See Appendix C for more on system trading.)
There's no question that the computer has revolutionized
financial market analysis and trading. While our interest is primarily
in technical analysis, software programs also allow you to blend
fundamental analysis with the technical. When the first edition of this
book was published in 1986, it cost about $5,000 to outfit yourself
with the necessary computer hardware to perform serious technical
analysis. The leading software package of the day cost close to
$2,000. How things have changed. You can now obtain incredibly
powerful computers for less than $2,000. Most software packages can
be had for less than $300. The better ones provide you with up to 20
years of historical price data on a CD-Rom disk at little or no
additional cost.
Another big benefit is the amount of educational help that you
can obtain with those software packages. The user manuals alone are
the size of a book and include technical formulas and all kinds of
useful explanations. The screening and alert capabilities of today's
computer are especially helpful to those monitoring global bond and
stock markets and thousands of individual common stocks, not to
mention mutual funds. In Chapter 17, we'll talk about an even more
sophisticated use of computer technology for developing neural
networks. But the message to you is clear. If you are serious about
investing or trading financial markets, get a computer and learn how
to use it. You'll be glad you did.

Money Management and
Trading Tactics

INTRODUCTION
The previous chapters presented the major technical methods
used to forecast and trade financial markets. In this chapter, we'll
round out the trading process by adding to the task of market forecasting the crucial elements of trading tactics (or timing) and the
often overlooked aspect of money management. No trading program can be complete without all three elements.

THE THREE ELEMENTS OF
SUCCESSFUL TRADING
Any successful trading program must take into account three important factors: price forecasting, timing, and money management.

393

www.Fxborssa.com

394

Chapter 16

1. Price forecasting indicates which way a market is expected to
trend. It is the crucial first step in the trading decision. The
forecasting process determines whether the trader is bullish or
bearish. It provides the answer to the basic question of whether
to enter the market from the long or short side. If the price
forecast is wrong, nothing else that follows will work.
2. Trading tactics, or timing, determines specific entry and exit
points. Timing is especially crucial in futures trading. Because
of the low margin requirements and the resulting high
leverage, there isn't much room for error. It's quite possible to
be correct on the direction of the market, but still lose money
on a trade if the timing is off. Timing is almost entirely
technical in nature. Therefore, even if the trader is
fundamentally oriented, technical tools must be employed at
this point to determine specific entry and exit points.
3. Money management covers the allocation of funds. It includes
such areas as portfolio makeup, diversification, how much
money to invest or risk in any one market, the use of stops,
reward-to-risk ratios, what to do after periods of success or
adversity, and whether to trade conservatively or aggressively.
The simplest way to summarize the three different elements is
that price forecasting tells the trader what to do (buy or sell), timing
helps decide when to do it, and money management determines how
much to commit to the trade. The subject of price forecasting has
been covered in the previous chapters. We'll deal with the other two
aspects here. We'll discuss money management first because that
subject should be taken into consideration when deciding on the
appropriate trading tactics.

MONEY MANAGEMENT
After having spent many years in the research department of a major
brokerage firm, I made the inevitable switch to managing money; I
quickly discovered the major difference between recommending
trading strategies to others and implementing them

www.Fxborssa.com

Money Management and Trading Tactics

39S

myself. What surprised me was that the most difficult part of the
transition had little to do with market strategies. The way I went
about analyzing the markets and determining entry and exit points
didn't change much. What did change was my perception of the
importance of money management. I was amazed at the impact such
things as the size of the account, the portfolio mix, and the amount of
money committed to each trade could have on the final results.
Needless to say, I am a believer in the importance of money
management. The industry is full of advisors and advisory services
telling clients what to buy or sell and when to do it. Very little is said
about how much of one's capital to commit to each trade.
Some traders believe that money management is the most
important ingredient in a trading program, even more crucial than the
trading approach itself. I'm not sure I'd go that far, but I don't think
it's possible to survive for long without it. Money management deals
with the question of survival. It tells the trader how to handle his or
her money. Any good trader should win in the long run. Money
management increases the odds that the trader will survive to reach
the long run.
Some General Money
Management Guidelines
Admittedly, the question of portfolio management can get very
complicated, requiring the use of advanced statistical measures. We'll
approach it here on a relatively simple level. The following are some
general guidelines that can be helpful in allocating one's funds and in
determining the size of one's trading commitments. These guidelines
refer primarily to futures trading.
1. Total invested funds should be limited to 50% of total capital.
The balance is placed in Treasury Bills. This means that at any
one time, no more than half of the trader's capital should be
committed to the markets. The other half acts as a reserve
during periods of adversity and drawdown. If, for example, the
size of the account is $100,000, only $50,000 would be
available for trading purposes.

www.Fxborssa.com

396

Chapter 16

2. Total commitment in any one market should be limited to 1015% of total equity. Therefore, in a $100,000 account, only
$10,000 to $15,000 would be available for margin deposit in
any one market. This should prevent the trader from placing
too much capital in any one trade.
3. The total amount risked in any one market should be limited to
5% of total equity. This 5% refers to how much the trader is
willing to lose if the trade doesn't work. This is an important
consideration in deciding how many contracts to trade and
how far away a protective stop should be placed. A $100,000
account, therefore, should not risk more than $5,000 on a
single trade.
4. Total margin in any market group should be limited to 20-25%
of total equity. The purpose of this criteria is to protect against
getting too heavily involved in any one market group. Markets
within groups tend to move together. Gold and silver are part
of the precious metals group and usually trend in the same
direction. Putting on full positions in each market in the same
group would frustrate the principle of diversification. Market
commitments in the same group should be controlled.
These guidelines are fairly standard in the futures industry,
but can be modified to the trader's needs. Some traders are more
aggressive than others and take bigger positions. Others are more
conservative. The important consideration is that some form of
diversification be employed that allows for preservation of capital
and some measure of protection during losing periods. (Although
these guidelines relate to futures trading, the general principles of
money management and asset allocation can be applied to all forms
of investing.)
Diversification Versus Concentration
While diversification is one way to limit risk exposure, it can be
overdone. If a trader has trading commitments in too many markets
at the same time, a few profitable trades may be diluted by a larger
number of losing trades. A tradeoff exists and the proper

www.Fxborssa.com

Money Management and Trading Tactics

397

balance must be found. Some successful traders concentrate their
trading in a handful of markets. That's fine as long as those markets
are the ones that are trending at that time. The more negative
correlation between the markets, the more diversification is achieved.
Holding long positions in four foreign currency markets at the same
time would not be a good example of diversification, since foreign
currencies usually trend in the same direction against the U.S. dollar.
Using Protective Stops
I strongly recommend the use of protective stops. Stop placement,
however, is an art. The trader must combine technical factors on the
price chart with money management considerations. We'll show how
this is done later in the chapter in the section on tactics. The trader
must consider the volatility of the market. The more volatile the
market is, the looser the stop that must be employed. Here again, a
tradeoff exists. The trader wants the protective stop to be close
enough so that losing trades are as small as possible. Protective stops
placed too close, however, may result in unwanted liquidation on
short term market swings (or "noise"). Protective stops placed too far
away may avoid the noise factor, but will result in larger losses. The
trick is to find the right middle ground.

REWARD TO RISK RATIOS
The best futures traders make money on only 40% of their trades.
That's right. Most trades wind up being losers. How then do traders
make money if they're wrong most of the time? Because futures
contracts require so little margin, even a slight move in the wrong
direction results in forced liquidation. Therefore, it may be necessary
for a trader to probe a market several times before catching the move
he or she is looking for.
This brings us to the question of reward-to-risk ratios.
Because most trades are losers, the only way to come out ahead is to
ensure that the dollar amount of the winning trades is greater

www.Fxborssa.com

398

Chapter 16

than that of the losing trades. To accomplish this, most traders use a
reward-to-risk ratio. For each potential trade, a profit objective is
determined. That profit objective (the reward) is then balanced
against the potential loss if the trade goes wrong (the risk). A commonly used yardstick is a 3 to 1 reward-to-risk ratio. The profit
potential must be at least three times the possible loss if a trade is to
be considered.
"Letting profits run and cutting losses short" is one of the
oldest maxims of trading. Large profits in trading are achieved by
staying with persistent trends. Because only a relative handful of
trades during the course of a year will generate large profits, it's
necessary to maximize those few big winners. Letting profits run is
the way that is done. The other side of the coin is to keep losing
trades as small as possible. You'd be surprised how many traders do
just the opposite.

TRADING MULTIPLE POSITIONS:
TRENDING VERSUS TRADING UNITS
Letting profits run isn't as easy as it sounds. Picture a situation where
a market starts to trend, producing large profits in a relatively short
period of time. Suddenly, the trend stalls, the oscillators show an
overbought situation and there's some resistance visible on the chart.
What to do? You believe the market has much higher potential, but
you're worried about losing your paper profits if the market should
fail. Do you take profits or ride out a possible correction?
One way to resolve that problem is to always trade in multiple
units. Those units can be divided into trading and trending positions.
The trending portion of the position is held for the long pull. Loose
protective stops are employed and the market is given plenty of room
to consolidate or correct itself. These are the positions that produce
the largest profits in the long run.
The trading portion of the portfolio is earmarked for shorter
term in-and-out trading. If the market reaches a first objective,

www.Fxborssa.com

Money Management and Trading Tactics

399

is near resistance and overbought, some profits could be taken or a
tight protective stop utilized. The purpose is to lock up or protect
profits. If the trend then resumes, any liquidated positions can be
reinstated. It's best to avoid trading only one unit at a time. The
increased flexibility that is achieved from trading multiple units
makes a big difference in overall trading results.

WHAT TO DO AFTER PERIODS OF
SUCCESS AND ADVERSITY
What does a trader do after a losing or a winning streak? Suppose
your trading equity is down by 50%. Do you change your style of
trading? If you've already lost half of your money, you now have to
double what you have remaining just to get back to where you were
in the first place. Do you get more selective choosing trades, or keep
doing the same things you were doing before? If you become more
conservative, it will be that much harder to win back your losses.
A more pleasant dilemma occurs after a winning streak. What
do you do with your winnings? Suppose you've doubled your money.
One alternative is to put your money to maximum use by doubling
the size of your positions. If you do that, however, what will happen
during the inevitable losing period that's sure to follow? Instead of
giving back 50% of your winnings, you'll wind up giving it all back.
So the answers to these two questions aren't as simple or obvious as
they might first appear.
Every trader's track record is a series of peaks and troughs,
much like a price chart. The trend of the equity chart should be
pointing upward if the trader is making money on balance. The worst
time to increase the size of one's commitments is after a winning
streak. That's much like buying into an overbought market in an
uptrend. The wiser thing to do (which goes against basic human
nature) is to begin increasing one's commitments after a dip in equity.
This increases the odds that the heavier commitments will be made
near the equity troughs instead of the peaks.

TRADING TACTICS
Upon completion of the market analysis, the trader should know
whether he or she wants to buy or sell the market. By this time,
money management considerations should have dictated the level of
involvement. The final step is the actual purchase or sale. This can be
the most difficult part of the process. The final decision as to how and
where to enter the market is based on a combination of technical
factors, money management parameters, and the type of trading order
to employ. Let's consider them in that order.
Using Technical Analysis in Timing
There's nothing really new in applying the technical principles
discussed in previous chapters to the timing process. The only real
difference is that timing covers the very short term. The time frame
that concerns us here is measured in days, hours, and minutes as
opposed to weeks and months. But the technical tools employed
remain the same. Rather than going through all of the technical
methods again, we'll limit our discussion to some general concepts.
1. Tactics on breakouts
2. The breaking of trendlines
3. The use of support and resistance
4. The use of percentage retracements
5. The use of gaps
Tactics on Breakouts: Anticipation or
Reaction?
The trader is forever faced with the dilemma of taking a position in
anticipation of a breakout, taking a position on the breakout itself, or
waiting for the pullback or reaction after the breakout occurs. There
are arguments in favor of each approach or all three combined. If the
trader is trading several units, one unit can be taken in each instance.
If the position is taken in antici-

www.Fxborssa.com

Money Management and Trading Tactics

401

pation of an upside breakout, the payoff is a better (lower) price if the
anticipated breakout takes place. The odds of making a bad trade,
however, are increased. Waiting for the actual breakout increases the
odds of success, but the penalty is a later (higher) entry price. Waiting
for the pullback after the breakout is a sensible compromise,
providing the pullback occurs. Unfortunately, many dynamic markets
(usually the most profitable ones) don't always give the patient trader
a second chance. The risk involved in waiting for the pullback is the
increased chance of missing the market.
This situation is an example of how trading multiple positions
simplifies the dilemma. The trader could take a small position in
anticipation of the breakout, buy some more on the breakout, and add
a little more on the corrective dip following the breakout.
The Breaking of Trendlines
This is one of the most useful early entry or exit signals. If the trader
is looking to enter a new position on a technical sign of a trend
change or a reason to exit an old position, the breaking of a tight
trendline is often an excellent action signal. Other technical factors
must, of course, always be considered. Trendlines can also be used
for entry points when they act as support or resistance. Buying
against a major up trendline or selling against a down trendline can
be an effective timing strategy.
Using Support and Resistance
Support and resistance are the most effective chart tools to use for
entry and exit points. The breaking of resistance can be a signal for a
new long position. Protective stops can then be placed under the
nearest support point. A closer protective stop could be placed just
below the actual breakout point, which should now function as
support. Rallies to resistance in a downtrend or declines to support in
an uptrend can be used to initiate new positions or add to old
profitable ones. For purposes of placing protective stops, support and
resistance levels are most valuable.

www.Fxborssa.com

402

Chapter 16

Using Percentage Retracements
In an uptrend, pullbacks that retrace 40-60% of the prior advance can
be utilized for new or additional long positions. Because we're
talking primarily about timing, percentage retracements can be
applied to very short term action. A 40% pullback after a bullish
breakout, for example, might provide an excellent buying point.
Bounces of 40-60% usually provide excellent shorting opportunities
in downtrends. Percentage retracements can be used on intra-day
charts also.
Using Price Gaps
Price gaps on bar charts can be used effectively in the timing of
purchases or sales. After an upmove, for example, underlying gaps
usually function as support levels. Buy a dip to the upper end of the
gap or a dip into the gap itself. A protective stop can be placed below
the gap. In a bear move, sell a rally to the lower end of the gap or into
the gap itself. A protective stop can be kept over the gap.
Combining Technical Concepts
The most effective way to use these technical concepts is to combine
them. Remember that when we're discussing timing, the basic
decision to buy or sell has already been made. All we're doing here is
fine tuning the entry or exit point. If a buy signal has been given, the
trader wants to get the best price possible. Suppose prices dip into the
40-60% buying zone, show a prominent support level in that zone,
and/or have a potential support gap. Suppose further that a significant
up trendline is nearby.
All of these factors used together would improve the timing
of the trade. The idea is to buy near support, but to exit quickly if that
support is broken. Violation of a tight down trendline drawn above
the highs of a downside reaction could also be used as a buying
signal. During a bounce in a downtrend, the breaking of a tight up
trendline could be a shorting opportunity.

COMBINING TECHNICAL FACTORS
AND MONEY MANAGEMENT
Besides using chart points, money management guidelines should
play a role in how protective stops are set. Assuming an account size
of $100,000, and using the 10% criteria for maximum commitment,
only $10,000 is available for the trade. The maximum risk is 5%, or
$5,000. Therefore, protective stops on the total position must be
placed in such a way that no more than $5,000 would be lost if the
trade doesn't work.
A closer protective stop would permit the taking of larger
positions. A looser stop would reduce the size of the position. Some
traders use only money management factors in determining where to
place a protective stop. It's critically important, however, that the
protective stop be placed over a valid resistance point for a short
position or below a valid support point for a long position. The use of
intraday charts can be especially effective in finding closer support or
resistance levels that have some validity.

TYPES OF TRADING ORDERS
Choosing the right type of trading order is a necessary ingredient in
the tactical process. We'll concern ourselves only with some of the
more common types of orders: market, limit, stop, stop limit, and
market-if-touched (M.I.T.).
1. The market order simply instructs your broker to buy or sell at
the current market price. This is usually preferable in fast
market conditions or when the trader wants to ensure that a
position is taken and to protect against missing a potentially
dynamic market move.
2. The limit order specifies a price that the trader is willing to
pay or accept. A buy limit order is placed below the current
market price and states the highest price the trader is willing to
pay for a purchase. A sell limit order is placed over the current
market price and is the lowest price the seller is

www.Fxborssa.com

404

Chapter 76

willing to accept. This type of resting order is used, for
example, after a bullish breakout when the buyer wants to buy
a downside reaction closer to support.
3. A stop order can be used to establish a new position, limit a
loss on an existing position, or protect a profit. A stop order
specifies a price at which an order is to be executed. A buy
stop is placed over the market and a sell stop under the market
(which is the opposite of the limit order). Once the stop price
is hit, the order becomes a market order and is executed at the
best price possible. On a long position, a sell stop is placed
below the market to limit a loss. After the market moves
higher, the stop can be raised to protect the profit (a trailing
stop). A buy stop could be placed above resistance to initiate a
long position on a bullish breakout. Since the stop order
becomes a market order, the actual "fill" price may be beyond
the stop price, especially in a fast market.
4. A stop limit order combines both a stop and a limit order. This
type of order specifies both a stop price where the trade is
activated and a limit price. Once the stop is elected, the order
becomes a limit order. This type of order is useful when the
trader wants to buy or sell a breakout, but wants to control the
price paid or received.
5. The market-if-touched (M.I.T.) order is similar to a limit
order, except that it becomes a market order when the limit
price is touched. An M.I.T. order to buy would be placed
under the market like a limit order. When the limit price is hit,
the trade is made at the market. This type of trade has one
major advantage over the limit order. The buy limit order
placed under the market does not guarantee a fill even if the
limit price is touched. Prices may bounce sharply from the
limit price, leaving the order unfilled. An M.I.T. order is most
useful when the trader wants to buy the dip, but doesn't want
to risk missing the market after the limit price is hit.

www.Fxborssa.com

Money Management and Trading Tactics

405

Each of these orders is appropriate at certain times. Each has
its own strong and weak points. Market orders guarantee a position,
but may result in "chasing" the market. Limit orders provide more
control and better prices, but risk missing the market. Stop limit
orders also risk missing the market if prices gap beyond the limit
price. Stop prices are strongly recommended to limit losses and
protect profits. However, the use of a buy or sell stop to initiate new
positions may result in bad fills. The market-if-touched order is
particularly useful, but is not allowed on some exchanges. Familiarize
yourself with the different types of orders and learn their strengths
and weaknesses. Each of them has a place in your trading plan. Be
sure to find out which types of orders are permitted on the various
financial exchanges.

FROM DAILY CHARTS TO
INTRADAY PRICE CHARTS
Because timing deals with very short term market action, intraday
price charts are especially useful. Intraday charts are indispensable
for day trading purposes, although that's not our focus here. We're
mainly interested in how intraday activity can be used to aid the
trader in the timing of purchases and sales once the basic decision to
enter or exit a market has been made.
It bears repeating that the trading process must begin with a
long range view and then gradually work toward the shorter term.
Analysis begins with monthly and weekly charts for long term
perspective. Then the daily chart is consulted, which is the basis for
the actual trading decision. The intraday chart is the last one viewed
for even greater precision. The long term chart gives a telescopic
view of a market. The intraday chart allows more microscopic study.
The technical principles already discussed are clearly visible on these
very sensitive charts. (See Figures 16.1-16.3.)

THE USE OF INTRADAY
PIVOT POINTS
In order to achieve earlier entry with even tighter protective stops,
some traders try to anticipate where a market will close by the use of
pivot points. This technique combines seven key price levels with
four time periods. The seven pivot points are the previous day's high,
low, and close and the current day's open, high, low, and close. The
four time periods are applied to the current trading day. They are the
open, 30 minutes after the open, midday (about 12:30 New York
time), and 35 minutes before the close.
These are average times and can be adjusted to the individual
markets. The idea is to use pivot points only as a timing device when
the trader believes a market is topping or bottoming. Buy or sell
signals are given as the pivot points are broken during the day. The
later in the day the signal is given, the stronger it is.

www.Fxborssa.com

408

Chapter 16

As an illustration of a buy signal, if the market opens above the
previous day's close, but is below the previous day's high, a buy stop
is placed above the previous day's high. If the buy stop is elected, a
protective sell stop is placed below the current day's low. At 35
minutes before the close, if no position has been taken, a buy stop is
placed above the current day's high, with a protective stop under
today's open. No action is generally taken during the first 30 minutes
of trading. As the day progresses, the pivot points are narrowed as are
the protective stops. As a final requirement on a buy signal, prices
must close above both the previous day's closing price and today's
opening price.

SUMMARY OF MONEY
MANAGEMENT AND
TRADING GUIDELINES
The following list pulls together most of the more important elements
of money management and trading.
1. Trade in the direction of the intermediate trend.
2. In uptrends, buy the dips; in downtrends, sell bounces.
3. Let profits run, cut losses short.
4. Use protective stops to limit losses.
5. Don't trade impulsively; have a plan.
6. Plan your work and work your plan.
7. Use money management principles.
8. Diversify, but don't overdo it.
9. Employ at least a 3 to 1 reward-to-risk ratio.
10. When pyramiding (adding positions), follow these guide
lines.
a. Each successive layer should be smaller than before.
b. Add only to winning positions.
c. Never add to a losing position.
d. Adjust protective stops to the breakeven point.
11. Never meet a margin call; don't throw good money after
bad.

Money Management and Trading Tactics

409

12. Close out losing positions before the winning ones.
13. Except for very short term trading, make decisions away from
the market, preferably when the markets are closed.
14. Work from the long term to the short term.
15. Use intraday charts to fine-tune entry and exit.
16. Master interday trading before trying intraday trading.
17. Try to ignore conventional wisdom; don't take anything said in
the financial media too seriously.
18. Learn to be comfortable being in the minority. If you're right on
the market, most people will disagree with you.
19. Technical analysis is a skill that improves with experience and
study. Always be a student and keep learning.
20. Keep it simple; more complicated isn't always better.

APPLICATION TO STOCKS
The trading tactics that we've covered in this chapter (and the
analytical tools in preceding chapters) also apply to the stock market,
with some minor adjustments. While futures traders focus on short to
intermediate trends, stock investors are more concerned with
intermediate to longer term trends. Stock trading places less emphasis
on the very short term and makes less use of intraday charts. But the
general principles remain the same for analyzing and trading
markets—whether they're in the futures pits of Chicago or on the
floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

ASSET ALLOCATION
The money management guidelines presented in this chapter refer
mainly to futures trading. However, many of the principles included
in that discussion relate to the need for proper diversification in one's
investment portfolio and touches on the subject of asset allocation.
Asset allocation refers to how a person's portfolio is divided among
stocks, bonds, and cash

www.Fxborssa.com

470

Chapter 16

(usually in the form of a money market fund or Treasury Bills). It can
also refer to how much of one's portfolio should be allocated to
foreign markets. Asset allocation also refers to how one's
stockholdings are spread among the various market sectors and
industry groups. And, more recently, it deals with how much of one's
portfolio should be allocated to traditional commodity markets.

MANAGED ACCOUNTS AND
MUTUAL FUNDS
Managed accounts have been available in the futures markets for
several years and have provided a vehicle for those wishing to put
some money into futures but lacked the expertise to do so themselves. Managed accounts have provided a sort of mutual fund
approach to futures. Even though managed futures accounts invest in
all futures markets—including currencies, commodities, bonds, and
stock index futures—they still provide some measure of
diversification from bonds and stocks. Part of the diversification is
due to their practice of trading from both the long and the short side.
Another part comes from the commodity portion itself. However, the
ability to devote some of one's assets to commodities was made even
easier during 1997.
Oppenheimer Real Assets, launched in March 1997, is the
first mutual fund devoted exclusively to commodity investing. By
investing in commodity-linked notes, the fund is able to fashion a
commodity portfolio that tracks the Goldman Sachs Commodity
Index, which includes 22 commodity markets. Since commodities
often trend in opposite directions to bonds and stocks, they provide
an excellent diversification vehicle. Proper diversification requires
spreading one's assets among market groups or classes that have a
low correlation to each other—in other words, they don't always
trend in the same direction. Commodities certainly fit that criteria.
We point these things out for two reasons. One is to show that
the areas of money management and asset allocation are very much
intertwined. The second is to show that the markets them-

www.Fxborssa.com

Money Management and Trading Tactics

411

selves are very much intertwined. In the next two chapters, you'll see
how closely linked the futures and stock markets really are, and why
it's important that stock investors keep informed of what's going on in
the futures markets. Chapter 17 will introduce you to intermarket
technical analysis.

MARKET PROFILE
We couldn't leave the subject of intraday charts without introducing
one of the most innovative approaches to intraday trading called
Market Profile. This trading technique was developed by J. Peter
Steidlmayer, a former floor trader on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Mr. Steidlmayer's approach has gained an enthusiastic following over
the past decade, especially in the futures markets. Market Profile can,
however, be applied to common stocks as well. It's not an easy
approach to grasp. But those traders that have done so give it very
high marks. Dennis Hynes, an expert in Market Profile trading,
explains the approach in Appendix B.

The Link Between
Stocks and Futures:
Intermarket Analysis

When the first edition of this book was published in 1986 the separation of the commodity futures world from the more traditional
world of stocks and bonds was already starting to break down.
Twenty years ago, commodities referred to such things as corn,
soybeans, porkbellies, gold, and oil. These were traditional commodities that could be grown, mined, or refined. Dramatic changes
took place from 1972 to 1982 with the introduction of futures
contracts on currencies, Treasury Bonds, and stock index futures. The
term "commodities" gave way to "futures" since bonds and stocks
were hardly commodities. But they were futures contracts. Since
then, the world of futures trading has blended with that of traditional
stocks and bonds to the point that they can hardly be separated. As a
result, the technical analysis methods used to analyze the different
financial markets have become more universally applied.

413

www.Fxborssa.com

474

Chapter 17

On any given day, quotes are readily available for dollar
futures, bond futures, and stock index futures—and they often move
in sync with one another. The direction those three markets move is
often affected by what happens in the commodity pits. Program
trading, which occurs when the price of the S&P 500 futures contract
is out of line with the S&P 500 cash index, is a day-to-day reality.
For those reasons, it seems clear that the more understanding you
have about the world of futures trading, the more insight you will
gain into the entire financial marketplace.
It has become clear that action in the futures markets can have
an important influence on the stock market itself. Early warnings
signs of inflation and interest rate trends are usually spotted in the
futures pits first, which often determine the direction stock prices will
take at any given time. Trends in the dollar tell us a lot about the
strength or weakness of the American economy, which also has a
major impact on corporate earnings and the valuation of stock prices.
But the linkage goes even deeper than that. The stock market is
divided into sectors and industry groups. Rotation into and out of
those groups is often dictated by action in futures. With the
tremendous growth in mutual funds, and sector funds in particular,
the ability to capitalize on sector rotation into winning groups and out
of losing ones has become much simpler.
In this chapter, we'll deal with the broader subject of intermarket analysis as it deals with the interplay between currencies,
commodities, bonds, and stocks. Our primary message is how closely
the four markets are linked. We'll show how to use the futures
markets in the process of sector and industry group rotation within
the stock market itself.

INTERMARKET ANALYSIS
In 1991, I wrote a book entitled Intermarket Technical Analysis. That
book described the interrelationships between the various financial
markets, which are universally accepted today. The book provided a
guide, or blueprint, to help explain the sequence that develops among
the various markets and to show how interdependent they really are.
The basic premise of intermarket analysis is that all financial markets
are linked in some way. That includes

www.Fxborssa.com

The Link Between Stocks and Futures: Intermarket Analysis

415

international markets as well as domestic ones. Those relationships
may shift on occasion, but they are always present in one form or
another. As a result, a complete understanding of what's going on in
one market—such as the stock market—isn't possible without some
understanding of what's going on in other markets. Because the
markets are now so intertwined, the technical analyst has an
enormous advantage. The technical tools described in this book can
be applied to all markets, which greatly facilitates the application of
intermarket analysis. You'll also see why the ability to follow the
charts of so many markets is a tremendous advantage in today's
complex marketplace.

PROGRAM TRADING:
THE ULTIMATE LINK
Nowhere is the close link between stocks and futures more obvious
than in the relationship between the S&P 500 cash index and the S&P
500 futures contract. Normally, the futures contract trades at a
premium to the cash index. The size of that premium is determined
by such things as the level of short term interest rates, the yield on the
S&P 500 index itself, and the number of days until the futures
contract expires. The premium (or spread) between S&P 500 futures
over the cash index diminishes as the futures contract approaches
expiration. (See Figure 17.1.) Each day, institutions calculate what
the actual premium should be—called fair value. That fair value
remains constant throughout the trading day, but changes gradually
with each new day. When the futures premium moves above its fair
value to the cash index by some predetermined amount, an arbitrage
trade is automatically activated— called program buying. When the
futures are too high relative to the cash index, program traders sell
the futures contract and buy a basket of stocks in the S&P 500 to
bring the two entities back into line. The result of program buying is
positive for the stock market since it pushes the S&P 500 cash index
higher. Program selling is just the opposite and occurs when the
premium of the futures over the cash narrows too far below its fair
value. In that case, program selling is activated which results in the
buying of S&P 500 futures and

selling of the basket of stocks. Program selling is negative for the
market. Most traders understand this relationship between the two
related markets. What they don't always understand is that the sudden
moves in the S&P 500 futures contract, which activate the program
trading, are often caused by sudden moves in other futures markets—
like bonds.

THE LINK BETWEEN BONDS
AND STOCKS
The stock market is influenced by the direction of interest rates. The
direction of interest rates (or yield) can be monitored on a minute-tominute basis by tracking the movements in the Treasury Bond futures
contract. Bond prices move in the opposite direction of

interest rates or yields. Therefore, when bond prices are rising, yields
are falling. That is normally considered positive for stocks.* Falling
bond prices, or rising yields, are considered negative for stocks. From
a technician's point of view, it is very easy to compare the charts of
Treasury Bond futures with the charts of either the S&P 500 cash
index or its related futures contract. You'll see that they have
generally trended in the same direction. (See Figure 17.2.) On a short
term basis, sudden changes in trend in the S&P 500 futures contract
are often influenced by sudden changes in the Treasury Bond futures
contract. On a longer range basis, changes in the trend of the
Treasury Bond contract often warn of similar turns in the S&P 500
cash index itself. In that sense, bond futures can be viewed as a
leading indicator for the stock market. Bond futures, in turn, are
usually influenced by trends in the commodity markets.
* In a deflationary environment, bonds and stocks usually decouple. Bond prices rise while
stock prices fall.

Figure 17.2 Rising bond prices are usually good for stock prices. The bond
market bottoms in 1981, 1984, 1988, 1991, and 1995 led to major upturns in
stocks. Bond peaks in 1987, 1990, and 1994 warned of bad stock market years.

THE LINK BETWEEN BONDS
AND COMMODITIES
Treasury Bond prices are influenced by expectations for inflation.
Commodity prices are considered to be leading indicators of inflationary trends. As a result, commodity prices usually trend in the
opposite direction of bond prices. If you study the market's history
since the 1970s, you'll see that sudden upturns in commodity markets
(signaling higher price inflation) have usually been associated with
corresponding declines in Treasury Bond prices. The flip side of that
relationship is that strong Treasury Bond gains have normally
corresponded with falling commodity prices. (See Figure 17.3).
Commodity prices, in turn, are impacted by the direction of the U.S.
dollar.

Figure 17.3 Commodity prices and bond prices normally trend in opposite
directions as shown here. The bond bottoms in the spring of 1996 and 1997
coincided with major peaks in commodity prices (see boxes).

THE LINK BETWEEN COMMODITIES
AND THE DOLLAR
A rising U.S. dollar normally has a depressing effect on most commodity prices. In other words, a rising dollar is normally considered
to be noninflationary. (See Figure 17.4.) One of the commodities
most effected by the dollar is the gold market. If you study their
relationship over time, you'll see that the prices of gold and the U.S.
dollar usually trend in opposite directions. (See Figure 17.5.) The
gold market, in turn, usually acts as a leading indicator for other
commodity markets. So, if you're analyzing the gold market, it's
necessary to know what the dollar is doing. If you're studying the
commodity price trend in general (using

one of the better known commodity price indexes), it's necessary to
know what the gold market is doing. The fact of the matter is that all
four markets are linked—the dollar influences commodities, which
influence bonds, which influence stocks. To fully comprehend what's
happening in any one asset class, it's necessary to know what's
happening in the other three. Fortunately, that's easily done by simply
looking at their respective price charts.

STOCK SECTORS AND
INDUSTRY GROUPS
An understanding of these intermarket relationships also sheds light
on the interaction between the various stock market sectors and
industry groups. The stock market is divided into market sec-

www.Fxborssa.com

421

The Link Between Stocks and Futures: Intermarket Analysis

tors which are then subdivided into industry groups. These market
categories are influenced by what's happening on the intermarket
scene. For example, when bonds are strong and commodities weak,
interest rate-sensitive stock groups—such as the utilities, financial
stocks, and consumer staples—usually do well relative to the rest of
the stock market. At the same time, inflation-sensitive stock groups—
like gold, energy, and cyclical stocks—usually underperform. When
commodity markets are strong relative to bonds, the opposite is the
case. By monitoring the relationship between Treasury Bond prices
and commodity prices, you can determine which sectors or industry
groups will do better at any given time.
Since there is such a close relationship between stock market
sectors and their related futures markets, they can be used in
conjunction with each other. Utility stocks, for example, are closely
linked to Treasury Bond prices. (See Figure 17.6.) Gold

mining shares are closely linked to the price of gold. What's more,
the related stock groups often tend to lead their respective futures
markets. As a result, utility stocks can be used as leading indicators
for Treasury Bonds. Gold mining shares can be used as leading
indicators for gold prices. Another example of intermarket influence
is the impact of the trend of oil prices on energy and airline stocks.
Rising oil prices help energy shares but hurt airlines. Falling oil
prices have the opposite effect.

THE DOLLAR AND LARGE CAPS
Another intermarket relationship involves how the dollar affects
large and small cap stocks. Large multinational stocks can be negatively impacted by a very strong dollar, which may make their
products too expensive in foreign markets. By contrast, the more
domestically oriented small cap stocks are less affected by dollar
movements and may actually do better than larger stocks in a strong
dollar environment. As a result, a stronger dollar may favor smaller
stocks (like those in the Russell 2000), while a weaker dollar may
benefit the large multinationals (like those in the Dow Industrial
Average.)

INTERMARKET ANALYSIS AND
MUTUAL FUNDS
It should be obvious that some understanding of these intermarket
relationships can go a long way in mutual fund investing. The
direction of the U.S. dollar, for example, might influence your
commitment to small cap funds versus large cap funds. It may also
help determine how much money you might want to commit to gold
or natural resource funds. The availability of so many sector-oriented
mutual funds actually complicates the decision of which ones to
emphasize at any given time. That task is made a good deal easier by
comparing the relative performance of the futures markets and the
various stock market sectors and industry groups. That is easily

RELATIVE STRENGTH ANALYSIS
This is an extremely simple but effective charting tool. All you do is
divide one market entity by another—in other words, plot a ratio of
two market prices. When the ratio line is rising, the numerator price
is stronger than the denominator. When the ratio line is declining, the
denominator market is stronger. Consider some examples of what
you can do with this simple indicator. Divide a commodity index
(such as the CRB Futures Price Index) by Treasury Bond futures
prices. (See Figure 17.7.) When the ratio line is rising, commodity
prices are outperforming bonds. In that scenario, futures traders
would be buying commodity markets and selling bonds. At the same
time, stock traders would be buying inflation sensitive stocks and
selling interest-rate sensitive stocks. When the ratio line

maceuticals, semiconductors, technology, and utilities. All of these
index options can be charted and analyzed like any other market. The
best way to use relative strength analysis on them is" to divide their
price by some industry benchmark such as the S&P 500. You can then
determine which are outperforming the overall market (a rising RS
line) or underperforming (a falling RS line). Employing some simple
charting tools like trendlines and moving averages on the relative
strength lines themselves will help you spot important changes in
their trend. (See Figure 17.9.) The general idea is to rotate your funds
into those sectors of the market whose relative strength lines are just
turning up, and to rotate out of those market groups whose relative
strength lines are just turning down. Those moves can be
implemented either with the index options themselves or through
mutual funds that match the various market sectors and industry
groups.

RELATIVE STRENGTH AND
INDIVIDUAL STOCKS
Investors have two ways to go at that point. They can simply rotate
their funds out of one market group into another and stop there. Or, if
they wish, they can continue on to choose individual stocks within
those groups. Relative strength analysis plays a role here as well.
Once the desired index has been chosen, the next step is to divide
each of the individual stocks within the index by the index itself. In
that way, you can easily spot the individual stocks that are showing
the greatest relative strength. (See Figure 17.10.) You can purchase
the stocks showing the strongest ratio lines, or you can buy a cheaper
stock whose ratio line may just be turning up. The idea, however, is
to avoid stocks whose relative strength (ratio) lines are still falling.

TOP-DOWN MARKET APPROACH
What we've described here is a top down market approach. You begin
by studying the major market averages to determine the trend of the
overall market. Then you select those market sectors or industry
groups that are showing the best relative strength. Then you select
individual stocks within those groups that are also showing the best
relative strength. By incorporating intermarket principles into your
decision making process, you can also determine whether the current
market climate favors bonds, commodities, or stocks which can play
a role in your asset allocation decisions. The same principles can also
be applied to international investing by simply comparing the relative
strength of the various global stock markets. And, finally, all of these
technical tools described herein can be applied to charts of mutual
funds as a final check on your analysis. All of this work is easily done
with price charts and a computer. Imagine trying to apply
fundamental analysis to so many markets at the same time.

DEFLATION SCENARIO
The intermarket principles described herein are based on market
trends since 1970. The 1970s saw runaway inflation which favored
commodity assets. The decades of the 1980s and 1990s have been
characterized by falling commodities (disinflation) and strong bull
markets in bonds and stocks. During the second half of 1997, a
severe downturn in Asian currency and stock markets was especially
damaging to markets like copper, gold, and oil. For the first time in
decades, some market observers expressed concern that a beneficial
disinflation (prices rising at a slower level) might turn into a harmful
deflation (falling prices). To add to the concerns, producer prices fell
on an annual basis for the first time in more than a decade. As a
result, the bond and stock markets began to decouple. For the first
time in four years, investors were switching out of stocks and putting
more money into bonds and rate-sensitive stock groups like utilities.
The rea-

428

Chapter 17

son for that asset allocation adjustment is that deflation changes
the intermarket scenario. The inverse relationship between bond
prices and commodities is maintained. Commodities fall while
bond prices rise. The difference is that the stock market can react
negatively in that environment. We point this out because it's
been a long time since the financial markets had to deal with the
problem of price deflation. If and when deflation does occur,
intermarket relationships will still be present but in a different
way. Disinflation is bad for commodities, but good for bonds and
stocks. Deflation is good for bonds and bad for commodities, but
may also be bad for stocks.
The deflationary trend that started in Asia in mid-1997
spread to Russia and Latin America by mid-1998 and began to
hurt all global equity markets. A plunge in commodity prices had
an especially damaging impact on commodity exporters like
Australia, Canada, Mexico, and Russia. The deflationary impact of
falling commodity and stock prices had a positive impact on
Treasury bond prices, which hit record highs. Market events of
1998 were a dramatic example of the existence of global intermarket linkages and demonstrated how bonds and stocks can
decouple in a deflationary world.

INTERMARKET CORRELATION
Two markets that normally trend in the same direction, such as
bonds and stocks, are positively correlated. Markets that trend in
opposite directions, like bonds and commodities, are negatively
correlated. Charting software allows you to measure the degree of
correlation between different markets. A high positive reading suggests a strong positive correlation. A high negative reading suggests
a strong negative correlation. A reading near zero suggests little or
no correlation between two markets. By measuring the degree of
correlation, the trader is able to establish how much emphasis to
place on a particular intermarket relationship. More weight should
be placed on those with higher correlations, and less weight on
those closer to zero. (See Figure 17.11.)

Figure 17.11 The line along the bottom shows the positive correlation
between T-bond prices and the S&P500. During the second half of 1997, the
Asian crisis caused an unusual decoupling. Investors bought bonds and sold
stocks.
In his book, Cybernetic Trading Strategies, Murray Ruggiero,
Jr. presents creative work on the subject of intermarket correlations.
He also shows how to use intermarket filters on trading systems. He
demonstrates, for example, how a moving-average crossover system
in the bond market can be used as a filter for stock index trading.
Ruggiero explores the application of state-of-the-art artificial
intelligence methods like chaos theory, fuzzy logic, and neural
networks to the development of technical trading systems. He also
explores the application of neural networks to the field of intermarket
analysis.

same time. That's where neural networks come into play. Neural
networks provide a more quantitative framework for identifying
and tracking the complex relationships that exist among the
financial markets. Louis Mendelsohn, president of Market Technologies Corporation (25941 Apple Blossom Lane, Wesley Chapel,
FL 33544; e-mail address: 45141@ProfttTaker.com; website URL:
www.ProfitTaker.com/45141), was the first person to develop
intermarket analysis software in the financial industry during the
1980s. Mendelsohn is the leading pioneer in the application of
microcomputer software and neural networks to intermarket
analysis. His VantagePoint software, first introduced in 1991, uses
intermarket principles to trade interest rate markets, stock indexes, currency markets, and energy futures. VantagePoint uses neural network technology to detect the hidden patterns and correlations that exist between related markets.

CONCLUSION
This chapter summarizes the main points included in my book,
Intermarket Technical Analysis. It discusses the ripple effect that
flows from the dollar to commodities to bonds to stocks.
Intermarket work also recognizes the existence of global linkages.
What happens in Asia, Europe, and Latin America has an impact
on U.S. markets and vice versa. Intermarket analysis sheds light on
sector rotation within the stock market. Relative strength analysis
is helpful for seeking out asset classes, market sectors, or individual stocks that are likely to outperform the general market. In his
book, Leading Indicators for the 1990s, Dr. Geoffrey Moore shows
how the interaction between commodity prices, bond prices, and
stock prices follows a sequential pattern that tracks the business
cycle. Dr. Moore substantiates the intermarket rotation within the
three asset classes, and argues for their use in economic forecasting. In doing so, Dr. Moore elevates intermarket work and technical analysis in general into the realm of economic forecasting.
Finally, technical analysis can be applied to mutual funds like any
other market (with some minor modifications). That being the
case, all of the techniques discussed in this book can be applied

right on the mutual fund charts themselves. Even better, the lower
degree of volatility in mutual fund charts make them excellent
vehicles for chart analysis. My latest book, The Visual Investor, deals
more extensively with the subject of sector analysis and trading, and
shows how mutual funds can be charted and then used to implement
various trading strategies. (See Figure 17.12.)

MEASURING MARKET BREADTH
In the previous chapter, we described the top-down approach that
is most commonly employed in stock market analysis. With that
approach, you begin your analysis with a study of the health of
the overall market. Then you work down to market sectors and
industry groups. The final step is the study of individual stocks.
Your goal is to pick the best stocks in the best groups in an environment when the stock market is technically healthy. The study
of market sectors and individual stocks can be accomplished with
the technical tools employed throughout this book—including
chart patterns, volume analysis, trendlines, moving averages,
oscillators, etc. Those same indicators can also be applied to the
major market averages. But there's another class of market indicators widely employed in stock market analysis whose purpose is to
determine the health of the overall stock market by measuring
market breadth. The data used in their construction are advancing versus declining issues, new highs versus new lows, and up
volume versus down volume.

The above figures are derived from New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE) data. A similar breakdown is also shown for the
NASDAQ and the American Stock Exchange. We'll concentrate on
the NYSE in this discussion. It just so happens that on that particular
day the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 12.20 points. So
the market was up as measured by the Dow. However, there were
more declining stocks (1,559) than advancing stocks (1,327),
suggesting that the broader market didn't fare as well as the Dow.
There was also more declining volume than advancing volume.
Those two sets of figures suggest that market breadth was actually
negative for that particular day—even though the Dow itself closed
higher. The other figures present a more mixed picture. The number
of stocks hitting new 52 week highs (78) was greater than those
hitting new lows (43) suggesting a positive market environment.
However, the closing tick (the number of stocks that closed on an
uptick versus a downtick) was a neg-

ative, -135. That meant that 135 more stocks closed on a downtick
than an uptick, a short term negative factor. The negative closing tick,
however, is offset by a closing Arms (Trin) reading of .96 which is
mildly positive. We'll explain why that is later in the chapter. All of
these internal market readings have one intended purpose—to give us
a more accurate reading on the health of the overall market that isn't
always reflected in the movement of the Dow itself.

COMPARING MARKET AVERAGES
Another way to study the breadth of the market is to compare the
performance of the stock averages themselves. Using the same day's
trading as an example, the following data lists the relative
performance of the major stock averages:
Dow Industrials
S&P 500

+12.20 (+.16%)
-.64 (-.07%)

Nasdaq Composite

-14.47 (-.92%)

Russell 2000

-3.80 (-.89%)

The first thing that is clear is that the Dow Industrials was the
only market average to gain on the day. On all the TV news programs
that night, investors were told that the market (represented by the
Dow) was up for the day. Yet all the other measures were actually
down. Notice also that the broader the average (the more stocks
included) the worse it did. Compare the percentage changes. The 30
stock Dow gained .16%. The S&P 500 lost .07%. The Nasdaq
Composite, which includes more than 5,000 stocks, was the day's
worst performer and lost .92%. Almost as bad as the Nasdaq was the
Russell 2000 (-.89%), which is a measure of 2000 small cap stocks.
The message in this brief comparison is that even though the Dow
gained on the day, the overall market lost ground as measured by the
more broader based stock averages. We'll revisit the idea of
comparing market averages again. But first, let's show the different
ways market technicians can analyze the market's breadth numbers.

THE ADVANCE-DECLINE LINE
This is the best known of the breadth indicators. The construction of
the advance decline line is extremely simple. Each day's trading on
the New York Stock Exchange produces a certain number of stocks
that advanced, a number that declined, and a number that remained
unchanged. These figures are reported each day in The Wall Street
Journal and Investor's Business Daily, and are used to construct a daily
advance-decline (AD) line. The most common way to calculate the
AD line is to take the difference between the number of advancing
issues and the number of declining issues. If there are more advances
than declines, the AD number for that day is positive. If there are
more declines than advances, the AD line for that day is negative.
That positive or negative daily number is then added to the
cumulative AD line. The AD line displays a trend of its own. The
idea is to make sure the AD line and the market averages are trending
in the same direction. (See Figure 18.1.)

AD DIVERGENCE
What does the advance-decline line measure? The advance-decline
line tells us whether or not the broader universe of 3500 NYSE stocks
is advancing in line with the most widely followed stock averages,
which include only the 30 Dow Industrials or the 500 stocks in the
S&P 500. To paraphrase a Wall Street maxim: the advance-decline
line tells us if the "troops" are keeping up with the "generals." As
long as the AD line is advancing with the Dow Industrials, for
example, the breadth or health of the market is good. The danger
appears when the AD line begins to diverge from the Dow. In other
words, when you have a situation where the Dow Industrials are
hitting new highs while the broader market (measured by the AD
line) isn't following, technicians begin to worry about "bad market
breadth" or an AD divergence. Historically, the AD line peaks out
well ahead of the market averages, which is why it's watched so
closely.

DAILY VERSUS WEEKLY AD LINES
The daily AD line, which we have described herein, is better used for
short to intermediate comparisons with the major stock averages. It is
less useful for comparisons going back several years. A weekly
advance-decline line measures the number of advancing versus
declining stocks for the entire week. Those figures are published in
Barron's each weekend. A weekly advance-decline line is considered
more useful for trend comparisons spanning several years. While a
negative divergence in the daily AD line may warn of short to
intermediate problems in the market, it's necessary to also show a
similar divergence in the weekly AD line to confirm that a more
serious problem is developing.

VARIATIONS IN AD LINE
Since the number of stocks traded on the NYSE has grown over the
years, some market analysts believe the method of subtract-

www.Fxborssa.com

438

Chapter 18

ing the number of declining issues from the number of advancing
issues gives greater weight to the more recent data. To combat that
problem, many technicians prefer to use an advance/decline ratio
which divides the number of advancing issues by the number of
declining issues. Some also believe that there's value in including the
number of unchanged issues in the calculation. Whichever way the
AD line is calculated, its use is always the same—that is, to measure
the direction of the broader market and to ensure it's moving in the
same direction as the more narrowly constructed, but popular market
averages. Advance decline lines can also be constructed for the
American Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Market. Market
technicians like to construct overbought/oversold oscillators on the
AD lines to help measure short to intermediate term market extremes
in the breadth figures themselves. One of the better known examples
is the McClellan Oscillator.

McCLELLAN OSCILLATOR
Developed by Sherman McClellan, this oscillator is constructed by
taking the difference between two exponential moving averages of
the daily NYSE advance-decline figures. The McClellan Oscillator is
the difference between the 19 day (10% trend) and the 39 day (5%
trend) exponential moving averages of the daily net advance decline
figures. The oscillator fluctuates around a zero line with its upper and
lower extremes ranging from +100 and -100. A McClellan Oscillator
reading above +100 is a signal of an overbought stock market. A
reading below -100 is considered an oversold stock market.
Crossings above and below the zero line are also interpreted as short
to intermediate term buying and selling signals respectively. (See
Figure 18.2.)

above the zero line are positive signals. Readings above +100 are overbought,
while readings below -100 are oversold. Notice the extreme oversold reading
during October of 1997.

McCLELLAN SUMMATION INDEX
The Summation Index is simply a longer range version of the
McClellan Oscillator. The McClellan Summation Index is a cumulative sum of each day's positive or negative readings in the
McClellan Oscillator. Whereas the McClellan Oscillator is used for
short to intermediate trading purposes, the Summation Index
provides a longer range view of market breadth and is used to spot
major market turning points. (See Figure 18.3.)

version of the McClellan Oscillator. The Summation Index is used for major
trend analysis. Crossings below zero are negative. The February 1998 signal
was positive.

NEW HIGHS VERSUS NEW LOWS
In addition to the number of advancing and declining stocks, the
financial press also publishes the number of stocks hitting new 52
week highs or new 52 week lows. Here again, these figures are
available on a daily and weekly basis. There are two ways to show
these figures. One way is to plot the two lines separately. Since the
daily values can sometimes be erratic, moving averages (usually 10
days) are plotted to present a smoother picture of the two lines. (See
Figure 18.4.) In a strong market, the number of new highs should be
much greater than the number of new lows. When the number of new
highs start to decline, or the number of new lows start to expand, a
caution signal is given. A negative market signal is activated when
the moving average of new lows crosses above

the moving average of new highs. It can also be shown that whenever
the new highs reach an extreme, the market has a topping tendency.
Similarly, whenever new lows reach an extreme, the market is near a
bottom. Another way to use the new highs versus new lows numbers
is to plot the difference between the two lines.

NEW HIGH-NEW LOW INDEX
The advantage of a New High-New Low index is that it can be
directly compared to one of the major market averages. In that way,
the high-low line can be used just like an advance-decline line. (See
Figure 18.5.) The trend of the high-low line can be chart-

ed and it can be used to spot market divergences. A new high in the
Dow, for example, that is not matched by a corresponding new high
in the high-low line could be a sign of weakness in the broader
market. Trendline and moving-average analysis can be applied to the
line itself. But its major value is in either confirming or diverging
from the major stock trends and giving early warning of potential
trend changes in the overall market. Dr. Alexander Elder describes
the New High-New Low index as "probably the best leading
indicator of the stock market" Trading for a Living, (Wiley).
Elder suggests plotting the indicator as a histogram with a
horizontal reference point at its zero line, making divergences easier
to spot. He points out that crossings above and below the zero line
also reflect bullish and bearish shifts in market psychology.

UPSIDE VERSUS DOWNSIDE
VOLUME
This is the third and final piece of data that is utilized to measure the
breadth of the market. The New York Stock Exchange also provides
the level of volume in both the advancing and declining issues. That
data is also available the next day in the financial press. It is then
possible to compare the upside volume versus the downside volume
to measure which is dominant at any given time. (See Figure 18.6.)
The upside volume and downside volume can be shown as two
separate lines (just as we did with the new highs and new lows
figures) or the difference can be shown as a single line. Either way,
the interpretation is always the same. When the upside volume is

Chapter 18

nant, the market is strong. When downside volume is greater, the
market is weak. It's possible to combine the number of advancing and
declining issues with advancing and declining volume. That's what
Richard Arms did in the creation of the Arms Index.

THE ARMS INDEX
The Arms Index, named after its creator Richard Arms, is a ratio of a
ratio. The numerator is the ratio of the number of advancing issues
divided by the number of declining issues. The denominator is the
advancing volume divided by declining volume. The purpose of the
Arms Index is to gauge whether there's more volume in rising or
falling stocks. A reading below 1.0 indicates more volume in rising
stocks and is positive. A reading above 1.0 reflects more volume in
declining issues and is negative. On an intraday basis, a very high
Arms Index reading is positive, while a very low reading is negative.
The Arms Index, therefore, is a contrary indicator that trends in the
opposite direction of the market. It can be used for intraday trading
by tracking its direction and for spotting signs of short term market
extremes. (See Figure 18.7.)

TRIN VERSUS TICK
The Arms Index (TRIN) can be used in conjunction with the TICK
indicator for intraday trading. TICK measures the difference between
the number of stocks trading on an uptick versus the number trading
on a downtick. The TICK is a minute-by-minute version of the daily
advance-decline line and is used for the same purpose. When
combining the two during the day, a rising TICK indicator and a
falling Arms Index (TRIN) are positive, while a falling TICK
indicator and a rising Arms Index (TRIN) are negative. The Arms
Index, however, can also be used for longer range analysis.

Stock Market Indicators

Figure 18.7 The Arms Index (also called TRIN) trends in the opposite
direction of the market. Exceptionally high spikes usually signal market bottoms. A 10-day moving average of the Arms Index is a popular way to view
this contrary indicator.

SMOOTHING THE ARMS INDEX
While the Arms Index is quoted throughout the trading day and has
some short term forecasting value, most traders use a 10 day moving
average of its values. According to Arms himself, a 10 day average
of the Arms Index above 1.20 is considered oversold, while a 10 day
Arms value below .70 is overbought, although those numbers may
shift depending on the overall trend of the market. Arms expresses a
preference for Fibonacci numbers as well. He suggests using a 21 day
Arms Index in addition to the 10 day version. He also utilizes 21 day
and 55 day moving-average crossovers of the Arms Index to generate
good intermediate term

trades. For more in-depth treatment, read The Arms Index (TRIN) by
Richard W. Arms, Jr.

OPEN ARMS
In calculating the 10 day Arms Index, each day's closing value is
determined using the four inputs and that final value is smoothed
with a 10 day moving average. In the "Open" version of the Arms
Index, each of the four components in the formula is averaged
separately over a period of 10 days. The Open Arms Index is then
calculated from those four different averages. Many analysts prefer
the Open Arms version to the original version. Different moving
average lengths, like 21 and 55 days, can also be applied to the Open
Arms version. (See Figure 18.8.)

Figure 18.8 The 10 day Open Arms Index gives a much smoother look to
this indicator, but still trends in the opposite direction of the market. A crossing of its 10-day moving average (darker line) often signals turning points.

EQUIVOLUME CHARTING
Although Arms is best known for creating the Arms Index, he has
also pioneered other ways of combining price and volume analysis.
In doing so, he created an entirely new form of charting called
Equivolume. In the traditional bar chart, the day's trading range is
shown on the price bar with the volume bar plotted at the bottom of
the chart. Since technical analysts combine price and volume
analysis, they have to look at both parts of the chart at the same time.
On the Equivolume chart, each price bar is shown as a rectangle. The
height of the rectangle measures the day's trading range. The width of
the rectangle is determined by that day's volume. Heavier volume
days produce a wider rectangle. Lighter volume days are reflected in
a narrower rectangle. (See Figure 18.9.)

448

Chapter 18

As a rule, a bullish price breakout should always be accompanied by a burst of trading activity. On an Equivolume chart,
therefore, a bullish price breakout should be accompanied by a
noticeably wider rectangle. Equivolume charting combines price and
volume analysis into one chart and makes for much easier
comparisons between price and volume. In an uptrend, for example,
up days should see wider rectangles while down days should see
narrower rectangles. Equivolume charting can be applied to market
averages as well as individual stocks and can be plotted for both
daily and weekly charts. For more information, consult Volume
Cycles in the Stock Market by Richard Arms (Dow Jones-Irwin,
1983).

CANDLEPOWER
In Chapter 12, Greg Morris explained candlestick charting. In a 1990
article published in Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities
magazine entitled "East Meets West: CandlePower Charting," Morris
proposed combining candlestick charts with Arms' Equivolume
charting method. Morris' version shows the candlestick chart in an
Equivolume format. In other words, the width of the candlestick is
determined by the volume. The greater the volume, the wider the
candlestick. Morris called the combination CandlePower charting.
Quoting from the article: "... the CandlePower chart offers similar if
not better information than Equivolume or candlestick charting and is
as visually appealing as either of them." Morris' CandlePower
technique is available on Metastock charting software (published by
Equis International, 3950 S. 700 East, Suite 100, Salt Lake City, UT
84107 [800] 882-3040, www.equis.com). However its name has been
changed to Candlevolume. (See Figure 18.10.)

COMPARING MARKET AVERAGES
At the start of the chapter, we mentioned that another way to gauge
market breadth was to compare the different market averages
themselves. We're talking here primarily about the Dow Industrials,
the S&P 500, the New York Stock Exchange Index, the Nasdaq
Composite, and the Russell 2000. Each measures a slightly different
portion of the market. The Dow and the S&P 500 capture the trends
of a relatively small number of large capitalization stocks. The NYSE
Composite Index includes all stocks traded on the New York Stock
Exchange, and gives a slightly broader perspective. Breakouts in the
Dow Industrials should, as a rule, be confirmed by similar breakouts
in both the S&P 500 and the NYSE Composite Index if the breakout
is to have staying power.

www.Fxborssa.com

450

Chapter 18

Most important divergences involve the Nasdaq and the
Russell 2000. The Nasdaq Composite has the largest number of
stocks (5000). However, since the Nasdaq is a capitalizationweighted index, it is usually dominated by the one hundred largest
technology stocks like Intel and Microsoft. Because of that, the
Nasdaq is more often a measure of the direction of the technology
sector. The Russell 2000 is a truer measure of the smaller stock
universe. Both indexes, however, should be trending upward along
with the Dow and the S&P 500 if the trend of the market is truly
healthy.
Relative strength (RS) analysis plays a useful role here. A
ratio of the Nasdaq to the S&P 500 tells us whether the technology
stocks are leading or lagging. It's usually better for the market if
they're leading and the ratio line is rising. (See Figure 18.11.) A

comparison of the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500 tells us whether
the "troops" are following the "generals." When the small stocks
are showing poor relative strength, or are lagging too far behind
the large stocks, that's often a warning that market breadth is
weakening. (See Figure 18.12.)

Chapter 18

CONCLUSION
Another example of comparing two market averages for signs of
confirmation or divergence involves the Dow Theory. In Chapter 2,
we discussed the importance of the relationship between the Dow
Industrials and the Dow Transports. A Dow Theory buy signal is
present when both averages hit new highs. When one diverges from
the other, a caution signal is given. It can be seen then that the study
of market breadth, and the related issues of confirmation and
divergence, can take many forms. The general rule to follow is that
the greater the number of stock market averages that are trending in
the same direction, the greater the chances are for that trend
continuing. In addition, be sure to check the advance-decline line, the
new highs-new lows line, and the upside-downside volume lines to
make sure that they're also trending in the same direction.

As this book has demonstrated, technical analysis is a blend of many
approaches. Each approach adds something to the analyst's
knowledge of the market. Technical analysis is much like putting
together a giant jigsaw puzzle. Each technical tool holds a piece of
the puzzle. My approach to market analysis is to combine as many
techniques as possible. Each works better in certain market situations. The key is knowing which tools to emphasize in the current
situation. That comes with knowledge and experience.
All of these approaches overlap to some extent and complement one another. The day the user sees these interrelationships,
and is able to view technical analysis as the sum of its parts, is the
day that person deserves the title of technical analyst. The following
checklist is provided to help the user touch all the bases, at least in
the early going. Later on, the checklist becomes second nature. The

ket analysis seldom consists of doing the obvious. The technician
is constantly seeking clues to future market movement. The final
clue that leans the trader in one direction or the other is often
some minor factor that has gone largely unnoticed by others. The
more factors the analyst considers, the better the chances of finding that right clue.

2. What is the direction of the various market sectors?
3. What are the weekly and monthly charts showing?
4. Are the major, intermediate, and minor trends up, down,
or sideways?
5. Where are the important support and resistance levels?
6. Where are the important trendlines or channels?
7. Are volume and open interest confirming the price action?
8. Where are the 33%, 50%, and 66% retracements?
9. Are there any price gaps and what type are they?
10. Are there any major reversal patterns visible?
11. Are there any continuation patterns visible?
12. What are the price objectives from those patterns?
13. Which way are the moving averages pointing?
14. Are the oscillators overbought or oversold?

22. Which way is the computer trend moving: up, down, or
sideways?
23. What are the point and figure charts or candlesticks showing?
After you've arrived at a bullish or bearish conclusion, ask
yourself the following questions.
1. Which way will this market trend over the next several months?
2. Am I going to buy or sell this market?
3. How many units will I trade?
4. How much am I prepared to risk if I'm wrong?
5. What is my profit objective?
6. Where will I enter the market?
7. What type of order will I use?
8. Where will I place my protective stop?
Going through the checklist won't guarantee the right
conclusions. It's only meant to help you ask the right questions.
Asking the right questions is the surest way of finding the right
answers. The keys to successful trading are knowledge, discipline,
and patience. Assuming that you have the knowledge, the best way to
achieve discipline and patience is doing your homework and having a
plan of action. The final step is putting that plan of action to work.
Even that won't guarantee success, but it will greatly increase the
odds of winning in the financial markets.

HOW TO COORDINATE
TECHNICAL AND
FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS
Despite the fact that technicians and fundamentalists are often at odds
with one another, there are ways they can work together for

Chapter 19

mutual benefit. Market analysis can be approached from either
direction. While I believe that technical factors do lead the known
fundamentals, I also believe that any important market move
must be caused by underlying fundamental factors. Therefore, it
simply makes sense for a technician to have some awareness of
the fundamental condition of a market. If nothing else, the technician can inquire from his or her fundamental counterpart as to
what would have to happen fundamentally to justify a significant
market move identified on a price chart. In addition, seeing how
the market reacts to fundamental news can be used as an excellent technical indication.
The fundamental analyst can use technical factors to confirm an analysis or as an alert that something important may be
happening. The fundamentalist can consult a price chart or use a
computer trend-following system as a filter to prevent him or her
from assuming a position opposite an existing trend. Some
unusual action on a price chart can act as an alert for the fundamental analyst and cause him or her to examine the fundamental
situation a bit closer. During my years in the technical analysis
department of a major brokerage firm, I often approached our
fundamental department to discuss some market move that
seemed imminent on the price charts. I often received responses
like "that can never happen" or "no way." Very often, that same
person was scrambling a couple of weeks later to find fundamental reasons to explain a sudden and "unexpected" market move.
There's obviously room for much more coordination and cooperation in this area.

CHARTERED MARKET
TECHNICIAN (CMT)
A lot of people use technical analysis and offer opinions on the
technical condition of the various markets. But are they really
qualified to do so? How would you know? After all, you wouldn't
go to a doctor who didn't have a medical degree on the wall. Nor

would you consult a lawyer who hadn't passed the bar exam. Your
accountant is undoubtedly a CTA. If you asked a security analyst for
an assessment on a common stock, you would certainly make sure
that he or she was a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA). Why
wouldn't you take the same precautions with a technical analyst? The
Market Technicians Association (MTA) resolved this question by
instituting a Chartered Market Technician (CMT) program. The
CMT program is a three step examination process that qualifies the
analyst to carry the CMT letters after his or her name. Most
professional technical analysts have gone through the program. The
next time someone offers you his or her technical opinion, ask to see
the CMT.

MARKET TECHNICIANS
ASSOCIATION (MTA)
The Market Technicians Association (MTA) is the oldest and best
known technical society in the world. It was founded in 1972 to
encourage the exchange of technical ideas, educate the public and the
investment community, and establish a code of ethics and professional standards among technical analysts. (On March 11, 1998
the MTA celebrated the 25th birthday of its incorporation. The event
was highlighted by a special presentation at the New York monthly
meeting by three of the organization's founding members—Ralph
Acampora, John Brooks, and John Greeley.) MTA membership
includes full-time technical analysts and other interested parties
(called affiliates). Monthly meetings are held in New York (Market

various locations around the country. Members have access to the
MTA library and a computer bulletin board. A monthly newsletter
and a periodic MTA Journal are published. Some regional chapters
have even been formed. MTA members also become colleagues of
the International Federation of Technical Analysts (IFTA).

THE GLOBAL REACH OF
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
During the fall of 1985, a meeting was held in Japan with technical
representatives of several different countries to draft a constitution
for the International Federation of Technical Analysts (IFTA, Post
Office Box 1347, New York, NY 10009 USA). Since then, the
organization has grown to include technical analysis organizations
from more than twenty countries. One of the nice things about being
a member is that annual meetings are held in places like Australia,
Japan, Paris, and Rome since a different national organization hosts
each seminar. I'm proud to say that in 1992 I received the first award
ever given at an IFTA conference for "outstanding contribution to
global technical analysis."

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS BY
ANY NAME
After a century of use in this country (and 300 years in Japan),
technical analysis is more popular than ever. Of course, it's not
always called technical analysis. In my book, The Visual Investor, I
called it visual analysis. That was simply an attempt to get people
beyond the intimidating title of technical analysis and to get them to
examine this valuable approach more closely. Whatever you want to
call it, technical analysis is practiced under many names. A lot of
financial organizations employ analysts whose job it is to numbercrunch market prices to find stocks or stock groups that are
expensive (overbought) or cheap (oversold). They're called
quantitative analysts, but the numbers they crunch are often the same
ones the technicians are crunching. The financial press has written
about a "new" class of trader called "momentum" players. These
traders move funds out of stocks and stock groups that are showing
poor momentum and into those that are showing good momentum.
They use a technique called relative strength. Of course, we
recognize "momentum" and "relative strength" as technical terms.
Then there are the brokerage firms' "fundamental" upgrades
and downgrades. Have you noticed how often these

www.Fxborssa.com

Pulling It All Together—A Checklist

459

"fundamental" changes take place the day after a significant "chart"
breakout or breakdown? Economists, who certainly don't consider
themselves technical analysts, use charts all the time to measure the
direction of inflation, interest rates, and all sorts of economic
indicators. And they talk about the "trend" of those charts. Even
fundamental tools like the price/earnings ratio have a technical side
to them. Anytime you introduce price into the equation, you're
moving into the realm of technical analysis. Or when security
analysts say the dividend yield of the stock market is too low, aren't
they saying prices are too high? Isn't that the same thing as saying a
market is overbought?
Finally, there are the academics who have reinvented
technical analysis under the new name of Behavioral Finance. For
years, the academics espoused the Efficient Market Hypothesis to
prove that technical analysis simply didn't work. No less an authority
than the Federal Reserve Board has thrown some doubt on those
ideas.

FEDERAL RESERVE
FINALLY APPROVES
During August of 1995, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
published a Staff Report under the title: "Head and Shoulders: Not
Just a Flaky Pattern." The report was intended to examine the validity
of the head and shoulders pattern in foreign exchange trading. (The
first edition of this book was cited as one of the primary sources on
technical analysis.) The opening sentence in the introduction reads:
Technical analysis, the prediction of price movements
based on past price movements, has been shown to generate statistically significant profits despite its incompatibility with most economists' notions of "efficient markets." (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, C.L. Osier and
P.H. Kevin Chang, Staff Report No. 4, August 1995.)
A more recent report, published in the fall of 1997 by the
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, also addresses the use of tech-

www.Fxborssa.com

460

Chapter 19

nical analysis and the relative merits of the Efficient Market
Hypothesis. (Technical Analysis of the Futures Markets was again
cited as a primary source of information on technical analysis.)
Under the paragraph titled, "Rethinking the Efficient Markets
Hypothesis," the author writes:
The success of technical trading rules shown in the previous section is typical of a number of later studies showing that the simple efficient market hypothesis fails in
important ways to describe how the foreign exchange
market actually functions. While these results did not
surprise market practitioners, they have helped persuade
economists to examine features of the market ... that
might explain the profitability of technical analysis.
(Neely)

CONCLUSION
If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then market technicians
should feel very flattered. Technical analysis is practiced under many
different names, and often by those who may not realize they're using
it. But it is being practiced. Technical analysis has also evolved. The
introduction of intermarket analysis, for example, has changed the
focus away from "single market" analysis to a more interdependent
view of the financial markets. The idea that all global markets are
linked isn't questioned much anymore either. That's why the
universal language of technical analysis makes it especially useful in
a world where the financial markets, here and abroad, have become
so intertwined. In a world where computer technology and lightningfast communications require quick responses, the ability to read the
market's signals is more crucial than ever. And reading market
signals is what technical analysis is all about. Charles Dow
introduced technical analysis at the start of the twentieth century. As
the twentieth century draws to a close, Mr. Dow would be proud of
what he started.

Appendix A: Advanced
Technical Indicators*

This appendix introduces several more advanced technical methods that can be used by themselves or with other technical studies. As with any technical approach, it is always recommended
that investors do their own independent testing and research
before actually investing.

DEMAND INDEX (DI)
Most technicians will agree that volume analysis is an important
ingredient in determining a market's direction. The Demand Index
(DI) is one of the early volume indicators that was developed in
the 1970s by James Sibbett. The formula is quite complex (see end
of this appendix). The Demand Index is the ratio of buying pres-

463

464

Appendix A

sure to selling pressure. When the buying pressure is greater than the
selling pressure, the DI is above the zero line, which is positive.
Greater selling pressure means the DI is below zero, which implies
prices will move lower. Most traders also look for divergences
between the DI and prices.
Figure A.l is a weekly chart of T-Bond futures from early
1994 until late 1997. From April to November 1994, the DI was
mostly below the zero line as bonds declined from 104 to the 96 area.
While prices made lower lows (line A), the DI formed higher lows
(line B). This is a classic positive, or bullish divergence, which
suggested that bond prices were bottoming. The divergence was
confirmed when the DI moved above the zero line at point 1. The DI
reached its highest level for this rally in late May
1995 at point 2, and then dropped for the next six weeks before

Figure A.1 The Demand Index (DI), which incorporates price and volume,
is shown here as a histogram. Values above zero are positive; below zero they
are negative. Notice the bullish divergence in late 1994 and the bearish
divergence in late 1995. (Courtesy MetaStock Equis International.)

crossing below the zero line at point 3. It stayed negative for five
weeks before it again turned positive. On the next rally the DI formed
a significantly lower high in late November at point 4. While the DI
was lower (line D), the bond contract was almost six points higher
(line C). This negative or bearish divergence warned of a price peak.
This indicator can also be used with stocks. The weekly chart
of General Motors (Figure A.2) shows the DI plotted as a line rather
than a histogram. This allows for trendlines to more easily be drawn
on the indicator. I have personally found trend-line analysis of
indicators to be quite valuable. Indicator trend-lines are often broken
ahead of price trendlines. This was the case in late 1995 as the
downtrend in the DI (line A) was broken

Figure A.2 The Demand Index (solid line) compared to a weekly chart
ofGM. Trendline breaks on the DI line often preceded trendline breaks on
the price chart. Notice the negative (bearish) divergence in April 1996.

a week before the corresponding price downtrend (line B). As this
chart indicates, buying just one week earlier could have significantly
improved the entry price. The DI also warned of a price high in midApril 1996. While GM was making a new price high (line C), the DI
had formed lower highs (line D). This warning signal came well
ahead of the serious price decline in June and July.

HERRICK PAYOFF INDEX (HPI)
This indicator was developed by the late John Herrick as a way of
analyzing commodity futures through changes in the open interest.
As discussed in Chapter 7, changes in the open interest can give
traders important clues as to whether a market trend is well supported
or not.
The Herrick Payoff Index uses price, volume, and open interest to determine money flow into or out of a given commodity. This
helps the trader spot divergences between the price action and the
open interest. This is often quite important as buying or selling
panics can often be identified through analysis of the open interest by
the Herrick Payoff Index.
The most basic interpretation of the HPI is whether it is above
or below the zero line. A positive value means that the HPI is
projecting higher prices and that open interest is rising along with
prices. Conversely, negative readings suggest that funds are flowing
out of the commodity being analyzed.
One of the more volatile commodity markets is coffee, featured in Figure A.3. During March and April of 1997, the HPI had
four crossings of the zero line with the last positive signal in early
April (B) lasting until early June. The HPI dropped below zero in
June, and even though prices were well below the highs, coffee
dropped another 70 cents. Once again the HPI turned positive in late
July very close to the lows. Over the next two months there were two
short term signals and then another longer term sell signal. This is
characteristic of the HPI when used on the daily data as it will cross
above and below the zero line several times before a longer lasting
buy or sell signal is given.

Figure A.3 The Herrick Payoff Index (HPI) shown as a histogram with
coffee prices. HPI uses price, volume, and open interest in its calculation and is
used in futures markets. Crossings above zero are buys (B); crossings below are
sells (S).

The HPI, like the Demand Index, is most effective when used
on the weekly data, as fewer false signals are evident. Divergence
analysis can also be used to warn the trader of a change from positive
to negative money flow. There are several good examples on the
weekly T-Bond futures charts (Figure A.4) that covers approximately
six years of trading. The HPI stayed positive from late 1992 until late
1993. The HPI peaked in early 1993 and, when bonds were almost 10
points higher (line A), the HPI was forming a lower high (line B).
This negative divergence warned bond traders of the decline in prices
that took place in 1994. The HPI violated the zero line in late October
of 1993, but then turned slightly positive in early 1994 before
plunging back below the zero line. The HPI reached its lowest

level in the first half of 1994 and bottomed well ahead of prices. As
prices were making lower lows (line C), the HPI was forming higher
lows and therefore a positive divergence (line D). The HPI moved
back into positive territory in December 1994 as bonds were very
close to their lows. A negative divergence was formed in late 1995
(line F), after bonds had rallied over 25 points from the late 1994
lows. The zero line was crossed several times in 1996 and early 1997
before the HPI moved firmly into positive territory. These two
examples should illustrate why the HPI and its analysis of open
interest can be helpful in analyzing a commodity market's direction.

STARC BANDS AND
KELTNER CHANNELS
As discussed in Chapter 9, banding techniques have been used for
many years. Two types that I prefer are based on the Average True
Range. Despite this common factor, these two types of bands are
used in very different ways. Average True Range is the average of
true price ranges over x periods. True Range is the greatest distance
from today's high to low, yesterday's close to today's high, or yesterday's close to today's low. See Welles Wilder's New Concepts in
Technical Trading Systems.
Manning StoUer, a well known expert in the commodity
business, developed the StoUer Average Range Channels or stare
bands. In his formula the 15 period Average True Range is doubled
and added to or subtracted from a 6 period moving average (MA).
The upper band is starc+; the lower is stare-. Movement outside of
these bands is uncommon and indicates an extreme situation. In this
manner they can be used as trading filters. When prices are near or
above the starc+ band, it is a high risk time to buy and a low risk time
to sell. Conversely, if prices are at or below the stare- band, then it is
a high risk selling zone and a more favorable point to buy.
The weekly continuation chart of gold futures (Figure A. 5) is
plotted with both the starc+ and stare- bands. In Feb. 1997 at point 1,
gold prices slightly overshot the stare- band. Though the price action
was weak, the stare bands indicated that this was not a good time to
sell. By waiting, a better selUng opportunity was likely to occur. Just
three weeks later gold was $22 higher and at the starc+ band (point
2). Point 2 was a low risk selling opportunity. In July (point 3), gold
prices dropped well below the stare-band, but instead of declining
further, prices moved sideways for the next 12 weeks. Gold prices
then started to move lower from November to December 1997 and
touched the stare- band three times (points 4). In all instances prices
did stabilize or move higher for 1-2 weeks. These bands work well in
all time frames even as short as 5 to 10 minute bar charts. Stare
bands can help the trader avoid chasing the market, which almost
always results in a poor entry price.

Figure A.5 Stare bands plotted around a 6 week moving average of weekly
gold prices. Points 1 and 3 show prices bouncing after dipping below the
lower band. Point 2 shows prices falling after rising above the upper band.

The Keltner channels were originally developed by Chester
Keltner in his 1960 book Hem to Make Money in Commodities.
Linda Raschke, a very successful commodity trader, has reintroduced them to technicians. In her modification, the bands are also
based on the average true range (ATR), but the ATR is calculated
over 10 periods. This ATR value is then doubled and added to a 20
period exponential moving average for the plus band and subtracted
from it for the minus band.
The recommended use of the Keltner channels is much different from the stare bands. When prices close above the plus band, a
positive signal is given as it indicates a breakout in upward volatility.
Conversely, when prices close below the lower band, it is negative
and indicates prices will move lower. In many respects, this is just a
graphical representation of a four week channel breakout system
discussed in Chapter 9.

With this indicator, moves below the lower channel (such as point 1) are
interpreted as a sign of weakness.

There were many other closes below the minus band during
this period. Until prices close above the plus band, the negative
signal will stay in effect. The second chart is March 1998 coffee
prices (Figure A. 7) and illustrates a positive signal at point 1. After
two consecutive closes above the plus band, prices then declined to
the 20 period EMA. In a rising market the 20 period EMA should act
as support. Several days after the EMA was touched (point 2), coffee
prices began a dramatic 30 cent rise in just a few weeks.

FORMULA FOR DEMAND INDEX
The Demand Index (DI) calculates two values, Buying Pressure (BP)
and Selling Pressure (SP), and then takes a ratio of the two. DI is
BP/SP. There are some slight variations in the formula. Here's one
version:
If prices rise:
BP = V or Volume
SP = V/P where P is the % change in price
If prices decline:
BP = V/P where P is the % change in price SP
= V or Volume
Because P is a decimal (less than 1), P is modified by multiplying it by the constant K.
P = P(K)
K = (3 x Q/VA
Where C is the closing price and VA (Volatility Average) is the 10
day average of a two day price range (highest high - lowest low).
If BP > SP then DI = SP/BP
The Demand Index is included on the MetaStock charting menu.

Market Profile*

INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this writing is to illustrate what Market Profile is and
to define its underlying principles. Before the early 1980s, the only
technical tools available were the bar chart and the point and figure
chart. Since then Market Profile®1 was introduced to expand the
arsenal of technical tools. Market Profile is essentially a statistical
approach to the analysis of price data.2 For those without a statistics
background, a familiar example may be helpful. Consider a group of
students taking an exam. Typically, some score very high (say 90 or
higher), some score very low (say

This appendix was prepared by Dennis C. Hynes.
'The Market Profile® is a registered trademark of the Chicago Board of Trade
(CBOT), hereafter referred to as Market Profile or the profile. The concept was developed by
J. Peter Steidlmayer, formerly of the CBOT. For further information on the subject, contact
the CBOT or read Mr. Steidlmayer's latest book: 141 WEST JACKSON—1996.

any price data series where continuous transaction activity is available.

60 or lower), but most scores tend to be clustered around the average
score (say 75). A histogram can be used to depict the frequency
distribution of these test scores in a "statistical picture" (Figure B.l).

Test Scores

As can be seen, the most frequent score, or modal score, is 75
(6 students) while the range of scores is defined by the lowest and
highest scores (55 and 95). Note how the scores distribute evenly
around the modal score. For a perfectly symmetric distribution, the
modal score will be equal to the mean, or average score. Next
observe that the distribution is "bell-shaped," the telltale sign of a
normal distribution. For a perfect normal distribution, specific
standard deviation intervals correlate to specific numbers of
observations. For example, if the test scores are, in fact, perfectly
normally distributed, then 68.3% of these scores will fall within one
(1) standard deviation of the mean. While actual data is unlikely to
form a perfect normal distribution, it is often close enough that these
relationships can be employed.
Prices, like other physical measurements (e.g., school test
grades, population heights, etc.), distribute around a mean price level
as well. What is the Market Profile graphic? Visualize it as simply, a
frequency distribution of prices displayed as a price histogram turned
on its side (see Figures B.2a and B.2b).

Flipped on its side.

The centerpiece of the Market Profile graphic is the (bellshaped) normal curve used to display the evolving price distribution.
Once the normal curve assumption is acknowledged, a modal or
average price can be identified, a price dispersion (standard
derivation) can be computed and probability statements can be made
regarding the price distribution. For example, virtually all values fall
within three (3) standard deviations of the average while about 70%
(68.3% to be exact) fall within one (1) standard
deviation of the average (see Figure B.3).
Market Profile provides a picture of what's
happening here and now in the marketplace.
In its pursuit of promoting trade, the market
is either in equilibrium or moving toward it.
The profile's natural tendency toward
symmetry defines, in a simple way, the
degree of balance (equilibrium) or imbalance
(disequilibrium) that exists between buyers
and sellers. As the market is dynamic, the
profile graphic portrays equilibrium as
periods of market balance—when price

Appendix B

Market Profile is not a trading system nor does it provide
trade recommendations. The aim of the profile graphic is to allow
the user to witness a market's developing value on price reoccurrence over time. As such, Market Profile is a decision support tool
requiring the user to exercise personal judgment in the trading
process.

MARKET PROFILE GRAPHIC
The Market Profile format organizes price and time into a visual
representation of what happens over the course of a single session. It provides a logical framework for observing market behavior in the present tense displaying price distributions over a period
of time. The price range evolves both vertically and horizontally
throughout the session. How is a profile graphic constructed?
Consider a 4 period bar chart (see Figure B.3a). This traditional bar chart can be converted to a profile graphic as follows:
(1) assign a letter for each price within each period's price range,
letter A for the 1st period, B for the 2nd, and so on (see Figure B.3b)
and then (2) collapse each price range to the leftmost or first column (see Figure B.3c). The completed profile graphic reflects
prices on the left and period frequency of price occurrence on the
right, represented by the letters A through D.

midnight to noon while lowercase letters from a through x represent the half-hour periods from noon to midnight.3

MARKET STRUCTURE
When you visit a commodities trading pit on a busy day, you
observe what is best described as "controlled chaos." Beneath the
screaming and gesturing locals and other traders, there is a
describable process. Think of the market as a place where participants with differing price needs and time constraints compete
with each other to get business done. Emotions can run high as
anxiety levels soar.
The Market Profile concept was introduced by Mr.
Steidlmayer in an attempt to help describe this process. As a
3Letter assignments can vary between vendors. For example, CQG assigns upper-

case letters A through Z from 8:00 am CST while lowercase letters from a through z from
10:00 p.m. CST.

Appendix B

CBOT floor trader (local) and student of market behavior, he
observed recurring patterns of market activity, which ultimately
lay the foundation for his understanding of the market. Since
the CBOT trading floor conducts trade in an auction-like manner, he defined Market Profile principles in auction terms. For
example, an off-the-floor trader would describe an advancing
market as one that is rallying or trading up, whereas Mr.
Steidlmayer would instead say something like, "the market continues to auction up, advertising for sellers to appear in order to
shut off buying."
To explain why a trading pit auction process works the
way it does, he invented some new terms unfamiliar to off-thefloor traders. He began with a definition of a market's purpose,
which is to facilitate trade. Next, he defined some operational
procedures, namely that the market operates in a dual auction
mode as prices rotate around a fair or mean price area (i.e., similar to the way school grades were distributed). Lastly, he
defined the behavior characteristics of market participants,
namely that traders with a short term time frame seek a fair
price, while traders with a longer term time frame seek an
advantageous price.

MARKET PROeLE
ORGANIZING PRINCIPLES
Auction Setting: The purpose of the marketplace is to facilitate
or promote trade. All market activity occurs within this auction
setting. Initially, as price moves higher, more buying comes in, as
price moves lower, more selling comes in. The market moves up
to shut off buying (i.e., auctioning up until the last buyer buys)
and moves down to shut off selling (i.e., auctioning down until
the last seller sells). The market actually operates through a dual
auction process. When price moves up and more buying comes
in, the up-move advertises for an opposite response (i.e., selling)
to stop the directional move. The opposite is true when price
moves down.

Continuous Negotiation: When a market

an unfair high and an unfair low, and then trades

Unfair High Area

trade takes place through this negotiating process
and remains within these parameters until one
side or the other side is eventually taken out (i.e.,
a new high or new low is formed), (see Figure
B.4.)
Market Balance and Imbalance: The
market is either in equilibrium or working toward
equilibrium between buyers and sellers. To
facilitate trade, the market moves from a state of
balance (equilibrium) to one of imbalance (disequilibrium ) and back to balance again. This
pattern of market behavior occurs in all times
frames, from intraday session activity to single session activity to
Unfair Low Area aggregated or consolidated sessions activity which
form the longer term auction. Time Frames and
Trader Behavior: The concept of different time frames was
Figure B.4 introduced to help explain the behavioral patterns of
market participants. Market activity is divided into two
timeframe categories, short term and longer term. The short term
activity is defined as day time frame activity where traders are forced
to trade today (e.g., locals, day traders and options traders on
expiration day fall into this category). With limited time to act, the
short term trader is seeking a fair price. Short term buyers and sellers
do trade with each other at the same time and at the same price.
Longer term activity is defined by all other timeframe activity (e.g.,
commercials, swing traders, and all other position traders fall into
this category). Not forced to trade today and with time as an ally,
these traders can seek a more advantageous price. In pursuit of their
interests, longer term buyers seek lower prices

www.Fxborssa.com

482

Appendix B

while longer term sellers seek higher prices. As their price objectives
differ, longer term buyers and sellers generally do not trade with
each other at the same price and at the same time. It is the behavioral
interaction between these two distinct timeframe types of activity
that causes the profile to develop as it does.
The Short Term Trader and Longer Term Trader Play
Different Roles: Short term and longer term traders play key, but
different, roles in facilitating trade. A market's initial balance (i.e., a
place where two-sided trade can occur) is usually established in the
first hour of trade by short term buyers and sellers (day timeframe
activity) in their pursuit of a fair price. Most of the day's activity
occurs in the fair price or value area. Prices above and below this
developed fair value area offer opportunity and are advantageous to
longer term traders. With time on their side, longer term traders can
either accept or reject prices away from fair value. By entering the
market with large enough volume, longer term buyers and sellers can
upset the initial balance, thereby extending the price range higher or
lower. The longer term trader is responsible for the way the day's
range develops and for the duration of the longer term auction. In
other words, the role of the longer term trader is to move the market
directionally.
Price and Value: The distinction between price and value
defines a market-generated opportunity. There are two kinds of
prices: 1) those that are accepted—defined as a price area where the
market trades over time and 2) those that are rejected— defined as a
price area where the market spends very little time. A rejected price
is considered excessive in the market—defined as an unfair high or
unfair low. Price and value are all but synonymous for short term
traders as they ordinarily trade in the fair value area. For longer term
traders, however, the concept that price equals value is often
inaccurate. Price is observable and objective while value is perceived
and subjective, depending upon the particular needs of longer term
traders. For example, a price at the top of today's range, while
excessive or unfair for today, is cheap to the longer term trader who
believes that prices next week will be much higher (i.e., today's price
is below next week's anticipated value).

Market Profile

Figure B.5 By combining daily consecutive profile graphics (upper) into a
larger cumulative profile graphic (lower), an evolving picture of long term
balance or imbalance emerges. (See explanation on page 489.)

The longer term trader distinguishes between price and value
by accepting or rejecting current prices away from his perception of
fair value. Recall that rising prices advertise for sellers while falling
prices advertise for buyers. When the longer term trader responds to
an advertised price, this behavior is expected and is referred to as
responsive. On the other hand, if the longer term trader did the
opposite (i.e., buy after prices rose or sell after prices declined), then
this unexpected activity is referred to as initiating. Classifying longer
term activity as responsive or initiating relative to yesterday's or
today's evolving value area provides anecdotal evidence of longer
term trader confidence. The more confident the trader becomes, the
more likely he is to take initiating action.

Appendix B

RANGE DEVELOPMENT AND
PROFILE PATTERNS
Since market activity is not arbitrary, it's not surprising that over time
recognizable price patterns reveal themselves. A skillful trader able
to anticipate such pattern development in its early stage may be able
to capitalize. Mr. Steidlmayer loosely identifies the following daily
range development patterns:
1. A normal day occurs when the longer term trader is relatively
inactive. The day's range is established in the pioneer range
(defined as the first column of prices) during the session's first
half-hour period of trade. The short term trader establishes the
initial balance, the unfair high and low, and then prices rotate
between these parameters for balance of the day (see Figure
B.6: Panel #1—Orange Juice).
2. A normal variation day occurs when the longer term trader is
more active and extends the range beyond the initial balance.
In this instance, the short term traders initial balance
parameters do not hold and there is some directional
movement which extends the range and sets a new high or
new low parameter. As a rule, the range extension beyond the
initial balance can be anywhere from a couple of ticks to
double the initial balance. This profile type is probably the
most common (see Figure B.6: Panel #2—Dow Jones
Industrial Average).
3. A trend day occurs when the longer term trader extends the
range successively further. In this instance, the range is
considerably more than double the initial balance with the
longer term trader controlling direction as the market continues its search for a fair price. Here the market moves in one
direction and closes at or near the directional extreme (see
Figure B.6: Panel #3—Japanese Yen).
4. A neutral day occurs when the longer term trader extends the
range after the initial balance in one direction, then reverses
and extends the range in the opposite direction. Neutral days
indicate trader uncertainty and occur when the market probes
or tests for price trend continuation or change (see Figure B.6:
Panel #4—Cattle).

Appendix B

TRACKING LONGER TERM
MARKET ACTIVITY
With the exception of option sellers who profit when prices
remain static, the profit strategy of most traders requires directional price movement. The trader wins when he gets the direction right and loses when he is incorrect. Because the longer term
trader is responsible for determining the market's directional
movement, we monitor this activity to help detect evidence of a
price trend. After identifying and evaluating longer term trader
activity, an educated conclusion regarding price direction can be
reached. We begin the process by identifying the longer term trader's influence in today's session and then considering how that
influence extends into the future.
• Influence in day's range development: The profile graphic helps identify longer term trader behavior during daily
range development. By monitoring longer term activity
throughout the range, particularly at the extremes, at range
extension, and after value area completion, we can determine whether longer term buyers or sellers are more active
and hence control market direction. Activity at the
extremes provides the clearest indication of longer term
trader influence, followed by range extension and then
value area buying and selling.
1. Extremes are formed when the longer term trader competes with the short term trader for opportunities at a particular price level (which later becomes either the session
high or low). A minimum of two single prints is required
to establish an extreme. The more eager the longer term
trader is in this price competition, the more the single
prints and the longer the single print extreme. Anything
less than two prints suggests that the longer term trader is
not very interested in competing at that price. A local top
or bottom is formed when only one single print defines
the top or bottom of the range. This condition implies
that the market offered a price opportunity which no one
really wanted (i.e., no evidence of competition [see Figure
B.7: Panel #1—Intel Corporation].

2. Range Extension occurs when the longer term trader enters
the market with enough volume to tip the initial balance
and extend the range up or down. Range extension up
indicates longer term buying while range extension down
indicates longer term selling. However, there are occasions
when both the longer term buyer and seller are active at a
range extreme, but not at the same price and time (recall
that longer term buyers and sellers generally do not trade
with each other). For example, if an extreme is formed
after a range extension up, the market moves up first to
shut off buying and then moves down to shut off selling.
This is an example of both longer term buyers and sellers
trading in the same price area but at different times. Both
kinds of activity at the extremes are identified to evaluate
the impact of longer term buying and selling (see Figure
B.7: Panel #2— Coffee).
3. The Value Area is determined each trading session by price
rotations around the modal price (i.e., the price with the
highest TPO count or the fairest price). The value area is
computed by counting 70% of all TPOs surrounding the
fairest price. In other words, the value area is an estimate
of fair value which is approximated by one standard
deviation of the session's trading volume (recall the student
example earlier). When a longer term trader makes a trade
in the value area, he is buying low or selling high in
relation to a longer term view, not in relation to today's
value. This behavior creates an imbalance in today's value
area. Longer term trader activity is measured by counting
TPOs. The following procedure can be used to determine
which side contains the longer term imbalance, 1) a line is
drawn through the fairest price, and 2) TPOs are counted
on either side of the fairest price until a single print is
encountered. The imbalance is assigned to the side with the
smaller number of TPOs because the longer term trader
activity represents the smaller percentage of total trade in
the value area. For example, if the TPO count was 22
above and 12

www.Fxborssa.com

Market Profile

489

below the fairest price, that would indicate net TPO selling
with a mild bias toward lower prices (see Figure B.7: Panel
#3—S&P 500 Index). Note that TPO buying and selling in
the value area is not applicable on trend days, as the
market is still in search of a fair value area.
After identifying and evaluating longer term trader activity
correctly in today's profile graphic, the user can readily determine
whether longer term buyers or sellers were in control of the current
trading session.
• Influence beyond today: The profile graphic also helps
identify longer term trader behavior beyond today's range
development. A key goal of the trader is to determine whether
the current market price trend will continue or is likely to
change. A change in market direction is a reversal of the
current price trend. The standard technical approach to trend
assessment, without Market Profile, is to draw an appropriate
trendline and monitor subsequent price action against it.
Unless the trendline is violated, the current price trend is
expected to continue. Trendline analysis is the most important
of basic technical tools, particularly given its universal usage
and applicability to different time intervals (i.e., hourly, daily,
weekly, monthly, etc.).
Market Profile, on the other hand, offers an alternative
approach to traditional trend analysis by evaluating market
activity over different time periods. In its simplest form, an
evaluation of the profile graphic on consecutive days can help
define the start or continuation of the short term price trend.
For example, if today's value area is higher than yesterday's
value area, then the current market price trend is up.
Moreover, if tomorrow's value area is higher than today's, then
the current market uptrend has continued. By monitoring
market activity in this fashion, the trader is able to readily
identify trend continuation or change. Similarly by combining
daily consecutive profile graphics into a larger cumulative
profile graphic, an evolving picture of longer term balance or
imbalance emerges. The profile graphic in Figure B.5 {Sugar)
on page 483 illustrate this

point. A cursory review of the individual sessions (2/10—
2/13) in the upper panel suggest an uptrending market
without a hint of reversal. When these four (4) consecutive
sessions are combined (lower panel), however, a cumulative
balanced picture springs forth. Once balanced, a market
moves to a state of imbalance which, more often than not,
begins after a final test at the fairest price.

CONCLUSION
The Market Profile method can be used to analyze any price data
series for which continuous transaction activity is available. This
includes listed and unlisted equities, U.S. government notes and
bonds (prices or yields), commodity futures and options, where
applicable. The profile graphic presents the movement of prices,
per unit of time, in two dimensions—vertically (i.e., directionally)
and horizontally (i.e., frequency of occurrence). When price
action is viewed in this way, a picture of price discovery unfolds
which is unavailable in the traditional one dimensional (vertical)
bar chart.
The profile graphic offers unique advantages over the standard bar chart:
• The symmetry attribute of the profile graphic allows the
trader to assess the market's state of balance (or imbalance)
in any timeframe. When a market is symmetric, a condition of balance or equilibrium exists between buyers and
sellers. A market imbalance implies price trend continuation, as the market works toward a new equilibrium.
Market balance, however, is fleeting and implies market
change or a directional move (either up or down) is likely to
occur, a signal for traders to consider employing trend following methodologies.
• Every trend change occurs at a single moment in time, not
conveniently at the end of the hour, day, week or month.
The profile graphic can be used to more accurately identify
that specific time where control changed hands between

www.Fxborssa.com

Market Profile

491

buyers and sellers. By pinning down such control shifts, the
profile graphic allows the trader to identify key support and
resistance levels.
In short, the profile graphic provides a substantial amount
of price information per unit of time, allowing the trader to identify patterns and dynamics which would not be readily apparent
using other methods.

Appendix C: The Essentials
of Building a Trading
System*

Trading system development is part art, part science, and part
common sense. Our goal is not to develop a system that achieves the
highest returns using historical data, but to formulate a sound concept
that has performed reasonably well in the past and can be expected to
continue to perform reasonably well in the future.
Ideally, we would prefer an approach that is 100% mechanical, increasing the odds that past performance can be replicated in
the future. Mechanical means objective: if 10 people follow the same
rules and achieve the same results, those rules are said to be
objective. It does not matter whether a mechanical system is written
on paper or entered into a computer.
*This appendix was prepared by Fred G. Schutzman.

493

494

Appendix C

Here, however, we'll assume that we are using a computer and will use the terms "mechanical" and "computerized"
interchangeably. This does not imply that a computer is
mandatory for trading system development, although it certainly helps.
The mechanical approach offers us three main benefits:
• We can back test ideas before trading them. A computer
allows us to test ideas on historical data rather than on hard
earned cash. By helping us see how a system would have performed in the past, it allows us to make better decisions
when it really counts—in the present.
• We can be more objective and less emotional. Most people have trouble applying their objective analysis to actual
trading situations. Analysis (where we have no money at
risk) is easy, trading (where we have money at risk) is stressful. Therefore, why not let the computer pull the trigger for
us? It is free of human emotion and will do exactly what we
had instructed it to do at the time when we developed our
system.
• We can do more work, increasing our opportunities. A
mechanical approach takes less time to apply than a subjective one, which allows us to cover more markets, trade
more systems, and analyze more time frames each day. This
is especially true for those of us who use a computer, since
it can work faster and longer than we can, without losing
its concentration.

5 STEP PLAN
1. Start with a concept
2. Turn it into a set of objective rules
3. Visually check it out on the charts
4. Formally test it with a computer
5. Evaluate the results

www.Fxborssa.com

The Essentials of Building a Trading System

495

STEP 1: START WITH A CONCEPT
(AN IDEA)
Develop your own concepts of how markets work. You can begin
by looking at as many charts as you can, trying to identify moving average crossovers, oscillator configurations, price patterns or
other pieces of objective evidence which precede major market
moves. Also attempt to recognize clues that provide advance
warning on moves that are likely to fail. I studied chart after chart
after chart in the hope of finding such answers. This "visual"
approach has worked for me, and I highly recommend it.
In addition to studying price charts and reading books
such as this one, I suggest you read about trading systems and
study what others have done. Although no one is going to reveal
the "Holy Grail" to you, there is a great deal of useful information out there. Most importantly, think for yourself. I have found
that the most profitable ideas are rarely original, but frequently
our own.
Most of the successful trading systems are trend following.
Counter trend systems should not be overlooked, however,
because they bring a degree of negative correlation to the table.
This means that when one system is making money, the other is
losing money, resulting in a smoother equity curve for the two
systems combined, than for either one alone.
Principles of Good Concept Design
Good concepts usually make good sense. If a concept seems to
work, but makes little sense, you may be sliding into the realm of
coincidence, and the odds of this concept continuing to work in
the future diminishes considerably. Your concepts must fit your
personality in order to give you the discipline to follow them even
when they are losing money (i.e. during periods of drawdown).
Your concepts should be straightforward and objective, and if
trend following, should trade with the major trend, let profits run
and cut losses short. Most importantly, your concepts must make
money in the long run (i.e. they must have a positive expectation).

www.Fxborssa.com

496

Appendix C

Designing entries is hard, but designing exits is harder and
more important. Entry logic is fairly straightforward, but exits have
to take various contingencies into account, such as how fast to cut
losses or what to do with accumulated profits. I prefer systems that
do not reverse automatically—I like to exit a trade first, before
putting on another trade in the opposite direction. Work hard to
improve your exits, and your returns will improve relative to your
risk.
Another suggestion—try to optimize as little as possible.
Optimization using historical data often leads one to expect unrealistic returns that cannot be replicated in real trading. Try to use few
parameters and apply the same technique across a number of
different markets. This will improve your chances of long run success, by reducing the pitfalls of over optimization.
The three main categories of trading systems are:
• Trend following. These systems trade in the direction of the
major trend, buying after the bottom and selling after the top.
Moving averages and Donchian's weekly rule are popular
methodologies among money managers.
• Counter trend
- Support/Resistance. Buy a decline into support; sell a rally
into resistance.
- Retracements. Here we buy pullbacks in a bull market and
sell rallies in a bear market. For example, buy a 50%
pullback of the last advance, but only if the major trend
remains up. The danger of such systems is that you never
know how far a retracement will go and it becomes
difficult to implement an acceptable exit technique.
- Oscillators. The idea is to buy when the oscillator is
oversold and to sell when it is overbought. If divergence
between the price series and the oscillator is also present, a
much stronger signal is given. However, it is usually best
to wait for some sign of a price reversal before buying or
selling.

• Pattern recognition (visual and statistical). Examples
include the highly reliable head and shoulders formation
(visual), and seasonal price patterns (statistical).

STEP 2: TURN YOUR IDEA INTO A SET
OF OBJECTIVE RULES
This is the most difficult step in our 5 step plan, much more difficult than many of us would at first expect! To complete this step
successfully, we must express our idea in such objective terms that
100 people following our rules will all arrive at exactly the same
conclusions.
Determine what our system is supposed to do and how it
will do it. It is with this step that we produce the details needed
to accomplish the programming task. We need to take the overall
problem and break it down into more and more detail until we
finalize all the details.

STEP 3: VISUALLY CHECK IT OUT ON
THE CHARTS
Following the explicit rules we just determined in Step 2, let us
visually check the trading signals that are produced on a price
chart. This is an informal process, meant to achieve two results:
first, we want to see whether our idea has been stated properly;
and second, before writing complicated computer code, we want
some proof that the idea is a potentially profitable one.

STEP 4: FORMALLY TEST IT
WITH A COMPUTER
Now its time to convert our logic into computer code. For my
own work, I use a program called TradeStation®, Omega
Research, Inc. in Miami, FL. TradeStation is the most compre-

www.Fxborssa.com

498

Appendix C

hensive technical analysis software package available for formulating
and testing trading systems. It brings together everything from the
visualization of your idea, to assistance in trading your system in real
time.
Writing code in any computer language is no easy task and
TradeStation's EasyLanguage™ is no exception. The job with
EasyLanguage, however, is greatly simplified because of the program's user friendly editor and the inclusion of many built in
functions and plenty of sample code. See Figure C.l.
Once our program has been written, we then move into the
testing phase. To begin with, we must choose one or more data series
to test. For stock traders this is an easy task. Futures traders,
however, are faced with contracts that expire after a relatively short
period of time. I like to do my initial testing using a continuous
(spread adjusted) price series popularized by Jack Schwager.
(Schwager on Futures: Technical Analysis, Wiley, 1996.) If those
results look promising, I then move on to actual contracts.
Next, we must decide how much data to use when building
our system. I use the entire data series, without saving any for out-ofsample testing (building your system on part of the data and then
testing it on the remaining "unseen" data). Many experts would
disagree with this approach, but I believe it to be the best with my
methodology that relies on good solid concepts, virtually no
optimization, and a testing procedure that covers a wide range of
parameter sets and markets. I start with a methodology that I believe
to be sound and then test it to either prove or disprove my theory. I
have found that most individuals do the reverse, they test a data
series to arrive at a trading system.
I do not account for transaction costs (slippage and commissions) when testing systems, but instead factor them in at the end.
I believe that this keeps the evaluation process more pure and allows
my results to remain useful should certain assumptions change in the
future.
I require my systems to work across:
• Different sets of parameters. If I were considering using a 5/20
moving average crossover system, then I would expect 6/18,
6/23, 4/21, and 5/19 to also perform reasonably well. If not, I
immediately become skeptical of the 5/20 results.

• Different periods of time (e.g. 1990-95 and 1981-86). A
system that tests well in the Japanese Yen over a recent five
year period should also test reasonably well over any other
five year interval. This is another area where I appear to hold
the minority point of view.
• Many different markets. A system that has worked well in
crude oil should also work well in heating oil and unleaded
gasoline over the same period of time. If not, I will look for an
explanation and will usually discard the system. I go even
further than this, however, and test that same system across
my entire database of markets, expecting it to perform well in
the majority of them.
Once our testing is complete, let us visually inspect the
computer generated trading signals on a price chart to ensure that the
system does what we intended it to do. TradeStation facilitates this
process by placing buy and sell arrows directly on the chart for us! If
the system does not do what it is supposed to do, we need to make
the necessary corrections to the code and test it again. Keep in mind
that very few ideas will test out profitably, usually less than 5%.
And, for one reason or another, most of these "successful" ideas will
not even be tradable.

STEP 5: EVALUATE RESULTS
Let us try to understand the concept behind our trading system. Does
it make sense or is it just a coincidence? Analyze the equity curve.
Can we live through the drawdowns? Evaluate the system on a tradeby-trade basis. What happens if a signal is a bad one? How quickly
does the system exit from losers? How long does it stay with the
winners? Make sure we are completely comfortable with the test
results, otherwise we will not be able to trade this system in real
time.
Three key TradeStation statistics to analyze are:
• Profit factor. Equals Gross profit on winning trades/Gross loss
on losing trades. This statistic tells us how many dollars our
system made for every $1 it lost, and is a measure

www.Fxborssa.com

The Essentials of Building a Trading System

501

of risk. Long term traders should aim for profit factors of
2.00 or higher. Short term traders can accept slightly lower
numbers.
• Avg trade (win & loss). This is our system's mathematical
expectation. It should at least be high enough to cover
transaction costs (slippage and commissions); otherwise we
will be losing money.
• Max intraday drawdown. This is the biggest drop, in dollar terms, from an equity peak to an equity trough. I prefer
to do this calculation on a percentage basis. I also differentiate between drawdowns from a standing start (where I am
losing money from my own pocket) versus drawdowns from
an equity peak (where I am giving back profits taken from
the markets). I am usually more lenient with the latter.

MONEY MANAGEMENT
Money management, while outside the scope of this appendix, is
an extremely important topic. It is the key to profitable trading,
every bit as important as a good trading system.
Money management techniques should be well thought
out. Accept the fact that losses are part of the game. Control your
downside and profits will take care of themselves.
In this area, practice diversification as much as possible.
Diversification will enable you to increase your returns while holding your risk constant, or decrease your risk while holding your
returns constant. Diversify among markets, systems, parameters,
and time frames.

CONCLUSION
We have discussed the basic philosophy of trading systems and
why objective is better than subjective. We covered the three main
benefits of a computerized approach and designed a 5 step plan for
building a trading system. And last, but not least, we touched upon
the importance of money management and diversification.

Appendix C

Trading systems can improve your performance and help to
make you a successful trader. The reasons for that are clear:
• they force you to do your homework before making a trade
• they provide a disciplined framework, making it easier for you
to follow the rules
• they enable you to increase your level of diversification
With lots of hard work and dedication, anyone can build a
successful trading system. It is not easy, but it certainly is within
reach. As with most things in life, what you get out of this effort will
be directly related to what you put into it. (See Figures C.2 and C.3.)

Figure C.2 (Price Chart): This trading system was designed to be applied
to a weekly chart of the Value Line Composite Index (VLCI), but also tested
well on a daily chart of the VLCI and on both weekly and daily charts in
other markets, votes of confidence in the underlying concept. This is the system described in Figure C.l.

Appendix D: Continuous
Futures Contracts*

With a clean database of "raw" commodity data, there are
numerous types of contracts that can be gleaned from the raw
data, such as: Nearest Contracts, Next Contracts, Gann
Contracts, and Continuous Contracts. Following, are ideas for
constructing these futures contracts derivatives. The symbols
used are for illustration purposes only. These continuous contracts can be created through the Dial Data Service (56 Pine
Street, New York, NY 10005, [212] 422-1600.)

*This appendix was prepared by Greg Morris.

506

Appendix D

NEAREST CONTRACT
A nearest contract is primarily used by traders who just want a
large file of continuous data made up of actual trading prices.
They are content with the data going to expiration and then
rolling over automatically.
It is quite probable that no one trades the nearest contract
within 15 to 30 days of expiration. This is because the liquidity
dries up very fast in the latter days of a contract. The number of
days before expiration that an individual rolls over to the next
contract is a function of the commodity that is being traded (the
number of months till the next contract), and the individual's
trading style. It is quite conceivable that the same individual will
rollover at different times for different commodities.
When to rollover to the next contract will more than likely
be based upon the current contract's volume. When it begins to
erode, that is the time to roll forward.
Therefore, one should have available a choice as to when to
rollover his Nearest Contract. Remember, Nearest Contracts are
made up of actual data. Here are some examples: Portfolio
Manager A is content to rollover at expiration; so all he wants is
the "standard" Nearest Contract with symbol TRNE00 (Treasury
Bonds). Manager A is probably managing money and needs equity
calculations which he can derive from the data. Trader B feels that
trading in the month of expiration is not liquid enough for him;
so he wants his Nearest Contract to roll over 15 days prior to
expiration—the symbol could be TRNE15. Analyst C would like to
evaluate different roll-over dates, so he might like to download
multiple Nearest Contracts, such as: TRNEOO, TRNE05, TRNE12,
and TRNE21 (which roll-over 5,12, and 21 days before expiration).
Keep in mind that all of these contracts are Nearest
Contracts and contain actual contract data. The only difference is
which actual contract the data comes from.

NEXT CONTRACT
A Next Contract is a unique offspring of the Nearest Contract. It
is exactly the same as the Nearest Contract except that it is always

www.Fxborssa.com

Continuous Futures Contracts

507

the contract that follows the Nearest Contract. In other words, if
the Nearest Contract is using December data for T-Bonds (TR),
then the Next Contract is using data from the March T-Bond contract. When the December contract expires, the Nearest rolls to
the March and the Next rolls to the June contract. This is defined
as the Next-1 contract.
From this concept, another Next Contract is available,
called a Next-2. Here, the data is always coming from the contract
that is two contracts away from the Nearest Contract. Keeping
with the above example, if the Nearest is using data from the
December contract, the Next-2 Contract is using data from the
June contract. When the December contract expires, the Nearest
begins to use data from the March contract and the Next-2
Contract uses data from the September contract and so on.
Ticker symbols for the Next contracts are: TRNXT1 and
TRNXT2. Of course, the actual futures ticker will be used instead
of the TR used in this example.

GANN CONTRACT
Gann Contracts refer to the use of a specific contract month and
rolling over only to the same contract in the next year. For example, July Wheat would be used until the July contract expires,
then the Gann Contract would start using data from the July
Wheat contract of the next year.
Examples of ticker symbols for Gann Contracts are:
W07GN, GC04GN, JY12GN, etc. (representing July Wheat, April
gold, December Japanese yen).

CONTINUOUS CONTRACTS
Continuous Contracts were developed to help analysts overcome
the problem of liquidity dry up and premium (or discount) gaps
in futures data. This becomes a problem whenever an analyst is
testing a trading model or system over many years of data. It
allows for a continuous stream of data with compensation being
made for rollover jumps in price trends.

Appendix D

CONSTANT FORWARD
CONTINUOUS CONTRACTS
A Constant Forward Continuous Contract looks a constant length
of time into the future. It uses more than one contract to do this.
A common method is to use the nearest two contracts and do a
linear extrapolation of the data. (See Figure D.l.)

Figure D.l A visual representation of a continuous contract.

One possibility is to give the futures trader (as with the
Nearest Contracts) the ability to construct his own Constant
Forward Continuous Contract. Three things are needed to do this:
The commodity symbol, the number of contracts he wants used
in the calculation, and the number of weeks into the futures he
wants to look. For instance, if he wanted T-Bonds, using 3 of the

www.Fxborssa.com

Continuous Futures Contracts

509

nearest contracts, and looking 14 weeks into the future, the symbol
could be: TRCF314. TR is the symbol, CF is for Continuous
(Forward Looking), 3 is the number of contracts used, and 14 is the
number of weeks the price is projected.
The mechanics of this are fairly simple. First, a fixed rollover
date would need to be set for each commodity. A good one to start
with could be 10 days prior to expiration. What is important is that
there is a rollover sometime prior to actual expiration. Second, the
number of contracts used will never be less than 2 and probably
never greater than 4. The number of weeks used should probably
always be greater that 3 and could go up to 40 in some cases.
Example: This is the method used by Commodity Systems,
Inc. (See Perpetual Contract in Chapter 8.)
T-Bonds will be used again, because they have a uniform
expiration cycle of every 3 months. Let's say a trader wants a
Continuous Contract of T-Bonds using the 2 nearest months and
looking 12 weeks into the future (symbol = TRCF212). Today's date
is December 1. A graphical portrayal makes this easier to understand
(see Figure D.l). The vertical axis is price and the horizontal axis is
time. Today's date is marked on the horizontal axis and the expiration
dates of the two nearest contracts (December and March), are also
marked. He wants to look 12 weeks into the future so a mark is made
12 weeks from today which is about February 25. The close price of
the December contract was 88.25 and the close of the March contract
was 87.75 These points are then put above their expiration dates at
the corresponding prices. Then a linear extrapolation is made by
merely drawing a line between the two points. The slope of this line
will vary up and down depending upon the outlook for long term
interest rates (in this T-Bond example). In this particular example the
outlook is for higher rates because the March futures price is lower
than the December price.
To find the value of the TRCF212 close price for today, find
the point on the horizontal axis that is 12 weeks from today (Feb
25th) and go up to the line drawn on the chart. Then from the line go
to the right and that is the price of the close for this Constant Forward
Continuous Contract (about 87.91). You can

also visually see from the chart that the March contract is carrying more weight than the December contract because the point of
interception is closer to March. This method can be done on the
Open, High, Low, and Close in the exact manner. Of course, a
computer does it mathematically; this is just a visual explanation
of how a Perpetual Contract is constructed.

Advance-decline line: One of the most widely used indicators
to measure the breadth of a stock market advance or
decline. Each day (or week) the number of advancing
issues is compared to the number of declining issues. If
advances outnumber declines, the net total is added to the
previous cumulative total. If declines outnumber advances,
the net difference is subtracted from the previous cumulative total. The advance-decline line is usually compared to
a popular stock average, such as the Dow Jones Industrial
Average. They should trend in the same direction. When
the advance-decline line begins to diverge from the stock
average, an early indication is given of a possible trend
reversal.
Arms index: Developed by Richard Arms, this contrary indicator
is a ratio of the average volume of declining stocks divided by
the average volume of advancing stocks. A reading below 1.0

511

www.Fxborssa.com

512

Glossary

indicates more volume in rising stocks. A reading above 1.0
reflects more volume in declining issues. A 10 day average of
the Arms index over 1.20 is oversold, while a 10 day average
below .70 is overbought.
Ascending triangle: A sideways price pattern between two converging trendlines, in which the lower line is rising while the
upper line is flat. This is generally a bullish pattern. (See
Triangles.)
Bar chart: On a daily bar chart, each bar represents one day's
activity. The vertical bar is drawn from the day's highest price
to the day's lowest price (the range). A tic to the left of the bar
marks the opening price, while a tic to the right of the bar marks
the closing price. Bar charts can be constructed for any time
period, including monthly, weekly, hourly, and minute periods.
Bollinger bands: Developed by John Bollinger, this indicator plots
trading bands two standard deviations above and below a 20
period moving average. Prices will often meet resistance at the
upper band and support at the lower band.
Breakaway gap: A price gap that forms on the completion of an
important price pattern. A breakaway gap usually signals the
beginning of an important price move. (See Gaps.)
Channel line: Straight lines drawn parallel to the basic trendline. In
an uptrend, the channel line slants up to the right and is drawn
above rally peaks; in a downtrend, the channel line is drawn
below price troughs and slants down to the right. Prices will
often meet resistance at rising channel lines and support at
falling channel lines.
Confirmation: Having as many market factors as possible agreeing
with one another. For example, if prices and volume are rising
together, volume is confirming the price action. The opposite of
confirmation is divergence.

www.Fxborssa.com

Glossary

513

Continuation patterns: Price formations that imply a pause or
consolidation in the prevailing trend. The most common
types are triangles, flags, and pennants.
Descending triangle: A sideways price pattern between two converging trendlines, in which the upper line is declining while
the lower line is flat. This is generally a bearish pattern. {See
Triangles.)
Divergence: A situation where two indicators are not confirming
each other. For example, in oscillator analysis, prices trend
higher while an oscillator starts to drop. Divergence usually
warns of a trend reversal. {See Confirmation.)
Double top: This price pattern displays two prominent peaks. The
reversal is complete when the middle trough is broken. The
double bottom is a mirror image of the top.
Down trendline: A straight line drawn down and to the right
above successive rally peaks. A violation of the down trendline usually signals a reversal of the downtrend. {See
Trendlines.)
Dow Theory: One of the oldest and most highly regarded technical theories. A Dow Theory buy signal is given when the
Dow Industrial and Dow Transportation Averages close above
a prior rally peak. A sell signal is given when both averages
close below a prior reaction low.
Elliott wave analysis: An approach to market analysis that is based
on repetitive wave patterns and the Fibonacci number
sequence. An ideal Elliott wave pattern shows a five wave
advance followed by a 3-wave decline. {See Fibonacci numbers).
Envelopes: Lines placed at fixed percentages above and below a
moving average line. Envelopes help determine when a market has traveled too far from its moving average and is
overextended.

514

Glossary

Exhaustion gap: A price gap that occurs at the end of an important
trend, and signals that the trend is ending. (See Gaps.)
Exponential smoothing: A moving average that uses all data points,
but gives greater weight to more recent price data. (See Moving
average.)
Fibonacci numbers: The Fibonacci number sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8,
13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144...) is constructed by adding the first two
numbers to arrive at the third. The ratio of any number to the
next larger number is 62 percent, which is a popular Fibonacci
retracement number. The inverse of 62 percent, which is 38
percent, is also used as a Fibonacci retracement number. The
ratio of any number to the next smaller number is 1.62 percent,
which is used to arrive at Fibonacci price targets. (See Elliott
wave analysis).
Flag: A continuation price pattern, generally lasting less than three
weeks, which resembles a parallelogram that slopes against the
prevailing trend. The flag represents a minor pause in a dynamic
price trend. (See Pennant.)
Fundamental analysis: The opposite of technical analysis.
Fundamental analysis relies on economic supply and demand
information, as opposed to market activity.
Gaps: Gaps are spaces left on the bar chart where no trading has
taken place. An up gap is formed when the lowest price on a
trading day is higher than the highest high of the previous day.
A down gap is formed when the highest price on a day is lower
than the lowest price of the prior day. An up gap is usually a
sign of market strength, while a down gap is a sign of market
weakness. Three types of gaps are breakaway, runaway (also
called measuring), and exhaustion gaps.
Head and shoulders: The best known of the reversal patterns. At a
market top, three prominent peaks are formed with the middle
peak (or head) slightly higher than the two other

www.Fxborssa.com

Glossary

515

peaks (shoulders). When the trendline (neckline) connecting
the two intervening troughs is broken, the pattern is complete. A bottom pattern is a mirror image of a top and is
called an inverse head and shoulders.
Intermarket analysis: An additional aspect of market analysis
that takes into consideration the price action of related market sectors. The four sectors are currencies, commodities,
bonds, and stocks. International markets are also included.
This approach is based on the premise that all markets are
interrelated and impact on one another.
Island reversal: A combination of an exhaustion gap in one
direction and a breakaway gap in the other direction within
a few days. Toward the end of an uptrend, for example, prices
gap upward and then downward within a few days. The
result is usually two or three trading days standing alone
with gaps on either side. The island reversal usually signals a
trend reversal. (See Gaps.)
Key reversal day: In an uptrend, this one day pattern occurs
when prices open in new highs, and then close below the
previous day's closing price. In a downtrend, prices open
lower and then close higher. The wider the price range on
the key reversal day and the heavier the volume, the greater
the odds that a reversal is taking place. (See Weekly
Reversal.)
Line charts: Price charts that connect the closing prices of a given
market over a span of time. The result is a curving line on the
chart. This type of chart is most useful with overlay or comparison charts that are commonly employed in intermarket
analysis. It is also used for visual trend analysis of open end
mutual funds.
MACD: Developed by Gerald Appel, the moving average convergence divergence system shows two lines. The first (MACD)
line is the difference between two exponential moving aver-

www.Fxborssa.com

516

Glossary

ages (usually 12 and 26 periods) of closing prices. The second
(signal) line is usually a 9 period EMA of the first (MACD)
line. Signals are given when the two lines cross.
MACD histogram: A variation of the MACD system that plots the
difference between the signal and MACD lines. Changes in the
spread between the two lines can be spotted faster, leading to
earlier trading signals.
McClellan oscillator: Developed by Sherman McClellan, this
oscillator is the difference between the 19 day (10% trend) and
the 39 day (5% trend) exponentially smoothed averages of the
daily net advance decline figures. Crossings above the zero line
are positive and below zero are negative. Readings above +100
are overbought while readings below -100 are oversold.
McClellan summation index: A cumulative sum of all daily
McClellan oscillator readings that provides longer range
analysis of market breadth. Used in the same way as an
advance-decline line.
Momentum: A technique used to construct an overbought-over-sold
oscillator. Momentum measures price differences over a
selected span of time. To construct a 10 day momentum line, the
closing price 10 days earlier is subtracted from the latest price.
The resulting positive or negative value is plotted above or
below a zero line. (See Oscillators.)
Moving average: A trend following indicator that works best in a
trending environment. Moving averages smooth out price action
but operate with a time lag. A simple 10 day moving average of
a stock, for example, adds up the last 10 days' closing prices and
divides the total by 10. That procedure is repeated each day.
Any number of moving averages can be employed, with
different time spans, to generate buy and sell signals. When
only one average is employed, a buy signal is given when the
price closes above the average. When

www.Fxborssa.com

Glossary

517

two averages are employed, a buy signal is given when the
shorter average crosses above the longer average. There are
three types: simple, weighted, and exponentially smoothed
averages.
On balance volume: Developed by Joseph Granville, OBV is a
running cumulative total of upside and downside volume.
Volume is added on up days and subtracted on down days. The
OBV line is plotted with the price line to see if the two lines are
confirming each other. [See Volume.)
Open interest: The number of options or futures contracts that are
still unliquidated at the end of a trading day. A rise or fall in
open interest shows that money is flowing into or out of a
futures contract or option, respectively. In futures markets,
rising open interest is considered good for the current trend.
Open interest also measures liquidity.
Oscillators: Indicators that determine when a market is in an
overbought or oversold condition. When the oscillator reaches
an upper extreme, the market is overbought. When the oscillator
line reaches a lower extreme, the market is oversold. (See
Momentum, Rate of change, Relative strength index, and
Stochastics.)
Overbought: A term usually used in reference to an oscillator. When
an oscillator reaches an upper extreme, it is believed that a
market has risen too far and is vulnerable to a selloff.
Oversold: A term usually used in reference to an oscillator. When an
oscillator reaches a lower extreme, it is believed that a market
has dropped too far and is due for a bounce.
Pennant: This continuation price pattern is similar to the flag, except
that it is more horizontal and resembles a small symmetrical
triangle. Like the flag, the pennant usually lasts from one to
three weeks and is typically followed by a resumption of the
prior trend.

Glossary

Percent investment advisors bullish: This measure of stock market
bullish sentiment is published weekly by Investor's Intelligence
of New Rochelle, New York. When only 35% of professionals
are bullish, the market is considered oversold. A reading of 55%
is considered to be overbought.
Price patterns: Patterns that appear on price charts and that have
predictive value. Patterns are divided into reversal and continuation patterns.
Rate of change: A technique used to construct an overboughtoversold oscillator. Rate of change employs a price ratio over a
selected span of time. To construct a 10 day rate of change
oscillator, the last closing price is divided by the closing price
10 days earlier. The resulting value is plotted above or below a
value of 100.
Ratio analysis: The use of a ratio to compare the relative strength
between two entities. An individual stock or industry group
divided by the S&P 500 index can determine whether that stock
or industry group is outperforming or underperforming the stock
market as a whole. Ratio analysis can be used to compare any
two entities. A rising ratio indicates that the numerator in the
ratio is outperforming the denominator. Trend analysis can be
applied to the ratio line itself to determine important turning
points.
Relative strength index (RSI): A popular oscillator developed by
Welles Wilder, Jr. and described in his self published 1978
book, New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems. RSI is plotted
on a vertical scale from 0 to 100. Values above 70 are considered to be overbought and values below 30, oversold. When
prices are over 70 or below 30 and diverge from price action, a
warning is given of a possible trend reversal. RSI usually
employs 9 or 14 time periods.
Resistance: The opposite of support. Resistance is marked by a
previous price peak and provides enough of a barrier above the
market to halt a price advance. (See Support.)

Retracements: Prices normally retrace the prior trend by a percentage amount before resuming the original trend. The best
known example is the 50% retracement. Minimum and maximum retracements are normally one third and two thirds,
respectively. Elliott wave analysis uses Fibonacci retracements
of 38% and 62%.
Reversal patterns: Price patterns on a price chart that usually
indicate that a trend reversal is taking place. The best known of
the reversal patterns are the head and shoulders and double and
triple tops and bottoms.
Runaway gap: A price gap that usually occurs around the midpoint
of an important market trend. For that reason, it is also called a
measuring gap. (See Gaps.)
Sentiment indicators: Psychological indicators that attempt to
measure the degree of bullishness or bearishness in a market.
These are contrary indicators and are used in much the same
fashion as overbought or oversold oscillators. Their greatest
value is when they reach upper or lower extremes.
Simple average: A moving average that gives equal weight to each
day's price data. (See Exponential smoothing and Weighted
average.)
Stochastics: An overbought-oversold oscillator popularized by
George Lane. A time period of 14 is usually employed in its
construction. Stochastics uses two lines—%K and its 3 period
moving average, %D. These two lines fluctuate in a vertical
range between 0 and 100. Readings above 80 are overbought,
while readings below 20 are oversold. When the faster %K line
crosses above the slower %D line and the lines are below 20, a
buy signal is given. When the %K crosses below the %D line
and the lines are over 80, a sell signal is given.
Support: A price, or price zone, beneath the current market price,
where buying power is sufficient to halt a price decline. A
previous reaction low usually forms a support level.

Glossary

Symmetrical triangle: A sideways price pattern between two converging trendlines in which the upper trendline is declining and
lower trendline is rising. This pattern represents an even balance
between buyers and sellers, although the prior trend is usually
resumed. The breakout through either trendline signals the
direction of the price trend. (See Ascending and Descending
triangles.)
Technical analysis: The study of market action, usually with price
charts, which includes volume and open interest patterns. Also
called chart analysis, market analysis and, more recently, visual
analysis.
Trend: Refers to the direction of prices. Rising peaks and troughs
constitute an uptrend; falling peaks and troughs constitute a
downtrend. A trading range is characterized by horizontal peaks
and troughs. Trends are generally classified into major (longer
than a year), intermediate (one to six months), or minor (less
than a month).
Trendlines: Straight lines drawn on a chart below reaction lows in
an uptrend, or above rally peaks in a downtrend, that determine
the steepness of the current trend. The breaking of a trendline
usually signals a trend reversal.
Triangles: Sideways price patterns in which prices fluctuate within
converging trendlines. The three types of triangles are the
symmetrical, the ascending, and the descending.
